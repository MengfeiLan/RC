anesthesia.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nseventy-five patients, 1-18 years of age (stratified for age; 1-3, 3-6, 6-18 years, for subgroup analyses), were included in this prospective observational study.\\tMETHODS\\nthe aepex and the bispectral index (bis) were recorded simultaneously, the latter serving as a reference.\\tMETHODS\\nthe ability of the aepex to detect different levels of consciousness, defined according to the university of michigan sedation scale, investigated using prediction probability (pk), and receiver operating characteristic (roc) analysis, served as the primary outcome parameter.\\tMETHODS\\nas a secondary outcome parameter, the relationship between end-tidal desflurane and the aepex and bis values were calculated by fitting in a nonlinear regression model.\\tMETHODS\\nthe pk values for the aepex and the bis were, respectively, .68 (95% ci, 0.53-0.82) and .85 (95% ci, 0.73-0.96; p = .02).\\tRESULTS\\nthe aepex and the bis had an area under the roc curve of, respectively, 0.89 (95% ci, 0.80-0.95) and 0.76 (95% ci, 0.68-0.84; p = .04).\\tRESULTS\\nthe maximized sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 81% (95% ci, 61%-93%) and 86% (95% ci, 74%-94%) for the aepex at a cutoff value of >52, and 69% (95% ci, 56%-81%) and 70% (95% ci, 57%-81%) for the bis at a cutoff value of >65.\\tRESULTS\\nthe age-corrected end-tidal desflurane concentration associated with an index value of 50 (ec50) was 0.59 minimum alveolar concentration (interquartile range: 0.38-0.85) and 0.58 minimum alveolar concentration (interquartile range: 0.41-0.70) for, respectively, the aepex and bis (p = .69).\\tRESULTS\\nage-group analysis showed no evidence of a difference regarding the area under the roc curve or ec50.\\tRESULTS\\nthe aepex can reliably differentiate between a conscious and an unconscious state in pediatric patients receiving desflurane-remifentanil anesthesia.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nbone-regulating hormones and nutrients play an important role in influencing metabolic health.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe aim of this study was to determine whether bone-regulating hormones and nutrients, such as parathyroid hormone (pth), 25-hydroxyvitamin d (25ohd), and magnesium (mg) could be used to characterize the metabolically healthy obese (mho) phenotype.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthis study included 27 overweight or obese participants (14 men/13 women) classified as mho ( n = 14) or metabolically unhealthy obese (muo) ( n = 13) based on the presence or absence of metabolic abnormalities, determined by percentage body fat, percentage trunk fat, and waist circumference.\\tMETHODS\\nbiochemical (serum concentrations of hormones and cytokines such as pth, 25ohd, ionized mg (img), cytokines, lipids, glycemic indices), physiological (percentage body fat, percentage trunk fat, blood pressure (bp)), and dietary intake (mg intake, calcium intake) measurements were obtained.\\tMETHODS\\nserum pth concentrations were significantly lower ( p = 0.005) in the mho group (39.68 +/- 11.06 pg/ml) compared with the muo group (63.78 +/- 25.82 pg/ml).\\tRESULTS\\nserum img concentrations were higher ( p = 0.052) in the mho group (0.565 +/- 0.41 mmol/l) than in the muo group (0.528 +/- 0.050 mmol/l).\\tRESULTS\\nserum concentrations of osteocalcin were also higher (10.37 +/- 3.70 ng/ml) in the mho compared with the muo (6.51 +/- 4.14 ng/ml) group ( p = 0.017).\\tRESULTS\\nthe mho group had significantly lower serum insulin concentrations ( p = 0.006) and diastolic bp ( p = 0.035).\\tRESULTS\\nconcentrations of serum 25ohd, total triglycerides, c-reactive protein and systolic bp did not differ between groups.\\tRESULTS\\nthese findings suggest that bone-regulating hormones and nutrients, especially serum pth, osteocalcin concentrations, and dietary mg intakes, can help to characterize the mho phenotype.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ngastric cancer (gc) is one of the most prevalent digestive malignancies.\\tBACKGROUND\\nmicrornas (mirnas) are involved in multiple cellular processes, including oncogenesis, and mir-592 itself participates in many malignancies; however, its role in gc remains unknown.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin this study, we investigated the expression and molecular mechanisms of mir-592 in gc.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nquantitative real-time pcr and immunohistochemistry were performed to determine the expression of mir-592 and its putative targets in human tissues and cell lines.\\tMETHODS\\nproliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated by cell counting kit-8, population doubling time, colony formation, transwell, and wound-healing assays in transfected gc cells in vitro.\\tMETHODS\\na dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to determine whether mir-592 could directly bind its target.\\tMETHODS\\na tumorigenesis assay was used to study whether mir-592 affected gc growth in vivo.\\tMETHODS\\nproteins involved in signaling pathways and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) were detected with western blot.\\tMETHODS\\nthe ectopic expression of mir-592 promoted gc proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and facilitated tumorigenesis in vivo.\\tRESULTS\\nspry2 was a direct target of mir-592 and spry2 overexpression partially counteracted the effects of mir-592.\\tRESULTS\\nmir-592 induced the emt and promoted its progression in gc via the pi3k/akt and mapk/erk signaling pathways by inhibiting spry2.\\tRESULTS\\noverexpression of mir-592 promotes gc proliferation, migration, and invasion and induces the emt via the pi3k/akt and mapk/erk signaling pathways by inhibiting spry2, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for gc.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nregularity of laminar origin and termination of projections appears to be a common feature of corticocortical connections.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe tested three models of this regularity, originally formulated for primate cerebral cortex, using quantitative data on the relative supragranular layer origins (sgn%) of 151 projections from 19 areas ( approximately 145,000 neurons) to four areas of cat extrastriate cortex.\\tOBJECTIVE\\npredictive variables in the models were: hierarchical level differences (barone et al., 2000), structural type differences (barbas, 1986), and distances (salin and bullier, 1995) between areas.\\tMETHODS\\nglobal and local hierarchies of cat visual cortex were used to evaluate the hierarchical model.\\tMETHODS\\nranking of areas by their cytoarchitectural differentiation (e.g., relative prominence of layer iv) allowed testing of the structural model, while the distance model was tested for the number of borders separating areas.\\tMETHODS\\nlaminar projection origins correlated moderately with hierarchical differences, and poorly with border distances, but were strongly and consistently correlated with area differences in cytoarchitectural rank.\\tRESULTS\\nmoreover, projection densities were moderately and negatively correlated with area distances and structural differences.\\tRESULTS\\nour findings suggest that the relative cytoarchitectural differentiation of cortical areas is the main determinant of laminar projection origins in cat visual cortex, and may underlie a general laminar regularity of mammalian cortical connections.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ndespite the growing interest in developing markers for predicting treatment response and optimizing treatment decisions, an appropriate methodology to identify, combine and evaluate such markers has been slow to develop.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe propose a step-by-step strategy for analysing data from existing randomised trials with the aim of identifying a multi-marker model for guiding decisions about treatment.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nwe start with formulating the treatment selection problem, continue with defining the treatment threshold, prepare a list of candidate markers, develop the model, apply the model to estimate individual treatment effects, and evaluate model performance in the study group of patients who meet the trial eligibility criteria.\\tMETHODS\\nin this process, we rely on some well-known techniques for multivariable prediction modelling, but focus on predicting benefit from treatment, rather than outcome itself.\\tMETHODS\\nwe present our approach using data from a randomised trial in which 808 women with multiple pregnancy were assigned to cervical pessary or control, to prevent adverse perinatal outcomes.\\tMETHODS\\noverall, cervical pessary did not reduce the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes.\\tRESULTS\\nthe treatment threshold was zero.\\tRESULTS\\nwe had a preselected list of 5 potential markers and developed a logistic model including the markers, treatment and all marker-by-treatment interaction terms.\\tRESULTS\\nthe model was well calibrated and identified 35% (95% confidence interval (ci) 32 to 39%) of the trial participants as benefitting from pessary insertion.\\tRESULTS\\nwe estimated that the risk of adverse outcome could be reduced from 13.5 to 8.1% (5.4% risk reduction; 95% ci 2.1 to 8.6%) through model-based selective pessary insertion.\\tRESULTS\\nthe next step is external validation upon existence of independent trial data.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nwe suggest revisiting existing trials data to explore whether differences in treatment benefit can be explained by differences in baseline characteristics of patients.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis could lead to treatment selection tools which, after validation in comparable existing trials, can be introduced into clinical practice for guiding treatment decisions in future patients.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ndiabetes mellitus is the most common chronic metabolic disease.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe raising diabetes epidemic is unfolding as an interaction between several environmental factors and a genetic predisposition.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of the ppargamma-pro12ala and enpp1-k121q polymorphisms on type 2 diabetes (t2d) risk in a case-control study in the tunisian population.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nto assess for any association of enpp1-k121q and ppargamma-pro12ala polymorphisms with t2d risk, we analysed the genotypic and allelic distributions of each variant in the studied cohort.\\tMETHODS\\nour results support that the genetic variation at enpp1-k121q predisposes to t2d in the tunisian population after adjustment on gender, age and bmi status (or=1.55, 95%ci [1.11-2.16], p=0.007).\\tRESULTS\\nconversely, the ppargamma-pro12ala variant seems not to have a significant effect on t2d risk in our tunisian cohort.\\tRESULTS\\nhowever, the minor a-allele would convey protection against overweight in the tunisian population.\\tRESULTS\\nin fact, the over weighted subjects showed a significantly lower frequency of a-allele than lean controls (or=0.49, 95%ci [0.25-0.97], p=0.02).\\tRESULTS\\nin conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that enpp1-121q is involved in the genetic susceptibility of t2d in the tunisian population, while the ppargamma-12ala allele may confer protection against overweight.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis systematic review aimed to synthesize the effects of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy to improve performance of activities of daily living (adls) in community-dwelling older adults.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nsearches were conducted in cinahl, the cochrane database of systematic reviews, medline, psycinfo, and otseeker.\\tMETHODS\\nempirical studies published between 1995 and 2015 were individually screened and appraised by two reviewers.\\tMETHODS\\nforty-three studies met the review inclusion and exclusion criteria.\\tRESULTS\\nphysical exercise was the most common intervention approach.\\tRESULTS\\nphysical exercise interventions for frail older adults showed a moderate benefit, but no benefits were found for older adults without noticeable difficulty in adls.\\tRESULTS\\nfor older adults with difficulty in adls, there was a high benefit of using home-based intervention.\\tRESULTS\\nthe findings of this systematic review highlight the importance of addressing older adults\\' living environment in intervention to promote independence in adls.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe prevalence of heart failure (hf) in the population is increasing, concomitant with high incidence of rehospitalizations and mortality.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe aim of this study was to characterize a prognostic risk score model for patients with chronic hf.\\tOBJECTIVE\\na total of 500 patients followed at the hf clinic were evaluated by clinical, functional, laboratory, imaging, and therapeutic variables that were correlated to mortality during a follow-up period of 25 months.\\tMETHODS\\nrisk stratification was carried out by applying a risk score model based on multivariate analysis.\\tMETHODS\\npredictors correlated with mortality during follow-up were systolic blood pressure <110 mm hg, male sex, age older than 70 years, 6-minute walk distance <300 m, lack of beta-blocker therapy, hyperuricemia (>7.5 mg/dl), hyponatremia, and prolonged qtc interval (>450 ms).\\tRESULTS\\nbased on these variables, a risk score model (score 0-55) was established and included low risk, score <21 (9% mortality during 2-year follow-up); moderate risk, 21 to 29 (22%); high risk, 30 to 35 (35%), and very high risk: >=36 points (62% 2-year mortality).\\tRESULTS\\nthe risk model had good discrimination ability (concordance index 0.75), which was better than the performance of the seattle heart failure model on our cohort (0.69).\\tRESULTS\\nsimple noninvasive characteristics examined during the initial admission to the hf clinic can serve as prognostic markers for mortality and may help in the process of therapeutic decision-making in patients with hf.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nextracellular high-mobility group box 1 (hmgb1) has been identified as playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of tissue fibrosis.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever, the underlying mechanism of its involvement in cardiac fibrosis is still not well-defined.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhere, we aim to investigate whether toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) contributes to the extracellular hmgb1-mediated development and progression of cardiac fibrosis.\\tOBJECTIVE\\na mouse model of cardiac fibrosis was induced by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (iso).\\tMETHODS\\nglycyrrhizic acid (ga), an inhibitor of hmgb1 derived from natural products, was simultaneously administered by intraperitoneal injection.\\tMETHODS\\nechocardiography, h&e and sirius red staining were used to evaluate cardiac function and fibrosis.\\tMETHODS\\nthe myocardial expression of autophagy-associated proteins was examined using immunoblotting.\\tMETHODS\\ncardiac fibroblasts were treated with different concentrations of hmgb1 to examine the expression levels of alpha-sma, collagen i and autophagy markers.\\tMETHODS\\ninteractions of hmgb1/tlr2 and alpha-sma/p62 were examined by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence.\\tMETHODS\\niso-treated mice showed characteristic cardiac fibrosis, increased expression and co-localization of hmgb1 and tlr2, as well as impaired autophagic signals in myocardial tissues, which could be prevented by silencing tlr2.\\tRESULTS\\nexogenous administration of hmgb1 blocked the autophagic flux in fibroblasts, which caused extensive accumulation of collagen i and alpha-sma.\\tRESULTS\\nin addition, cardiac fibrosis was alleviated by ga treatment through abrogating the interaction between hmgb1 and tlr2.\\tRESULTS\\nour study suggests that the interaction between tlr2 and hmgb1 contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis via suppressing fibroblast autophagy, and that inhibiting hmgb1 with ga provides therapeutic benefits for the treatment of fibroproliferative heart diseases.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe present guidelines on dermatomyositis (dm) represent an excerpt from the interdisciplinary s2k guidelines on myositis syndromes of the german society of neurology (available at www.awmf.org).\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe cardinal symptom of myositis in dm is symmetrical proximal muscle weakness.\\tBACKGROUND\\nelevated creatine kinase, crp or esr as well as electromyography and muscle biopsy also provide important diagnostic clues.\\tBACKGROUND\\npharyngeal, respiratory, cardiac, and neck muscles may also be affected.\\tBACKGROUND\\ngiven that approximately 30 % of patients also develop interstitial lung disease, pulmonary function tests should be part of the diagnostic workup.\\tRESULTS\\nalthough the cutaneous manifestations in dm are variable, taken together, they represent a characteristic and crucial diagnostic criterion for dm.\\tRESULTS\\napproximately 5-20 % of individuals exhibit typical skin lesions without any clinically manifest muscle involvement (amyopathic dm).\\tRESULTS\\nabout 30 % of adult dm cases are associated with a malignancy.\\tRESULTS\\nthis fact, however, should not delay the treatment of severe myositis.\\tRESULTS\\ncorticosteroids are the therapy of choice in myositis (1-2 mg/kg).\\tRESULTS\\nadditional immunosuppressive therapy is frequently required (azathioprine, for children methotrexate).\\tRESULTS\\nin case of insufficient therapeutic response, the use of intravenous immunoglobulins is justified.\\tRESULTS\\nthe benefit of rituximab has not been conclusively ascertained yet.\\tRESULTS\\nacute therapeutic management is usually followed by low-dose maintenance therapy for one to three years.\\tRESULTS\\nskin lesions do not always respond sufficiently to myositis therapy.\\tRESULTS\\neffective treatment for such cases consists of topical corticosteroids and sometimes also calcineurin inhibitors.\\tRESULTS\\nsystemic therapies shown to be effective include antimalarial agents (also in combination), methotrexate, and corticosteroids.\\tRESULTS\\nintravenous immunoglobulins or rituximab may also be helpful.\\tRESULTS\\nuv protection is an important prophylactic measure.\\tRESULTS\\nthe retrofacial approach is a feasible approach to the round window niche and that the round window-sigmoid sinus line will help determine the feasibility of retrofacial approach for cochlear implantation unless there is a very high jugular bulb.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nwhen the round window cannot be visualized by facial recess approach during cochlear implantation, other conservative techniques can be used to improve visualization such as the retrofacial approach.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthirteen adult dry cadaveric temporal bones were studied.\\tMETHODS\\ncomputed tomography (ct) scan was obtained on all temporal bones.\\tMETHODS\\nan imaginary round window-sigmoid sinus line was drawn on the axial images.\\tMETHODS\\nwe assessed whether this line is anterior (including intersection) or posterior to the facial nerve (fn).\\tMETHODS\\nthe following closest distances were measured on ct scans: 1) posterior semicircular canal (psc)-fn, 2) psc-stapedius muscle, 3) psc-jugular bulb, 4) lateral semicircular canal (lsc)-jugular bulb, 5) sigmoid sinus-fn.\\tMETHODS\\na canal wall-up mastoidectomy, facial recess, and retrofacial approach were performed in all specimens.\\tMETHODS\\nwe have noted whether we need a standard or an extended mastoidectomy.\\tMETHODS\\nthe round window-sigmoid sinus line was posterior to the fn in all specimens.\\tRESULTS\\nthe retrofacial approach was feasible and the round window was visualized in all specimens.\\tRESULTS\\nextended mastoidectomy was required in seven specimens and the psc-fn was </= 3 mm in five of them.\\tRESULTS\\nretrofacial approach is feasible in cochlear implantation when the round window-sigmoid sinus line is posterior to the fn and the jugular bulb is not obstructing the round window.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nhealth benefits of physical activity may depend on a concomitant weight loss.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin a randomized, controlled trial, we compared the effects of endurance training with or without weight loss to the effect of weight loss induced by an energy-reduced diet in 48 sedentary, moderately overweight men who completed a 12-week intervention program of training (t), energy-reduced diet (d), training and increased diet (t-id), or control (c).\\tOBJECTIVE\\nan energy deficit of 600 kcal/day was induced by endurance training or diet in t and d and a similar training regimen plus an increased dietary intake of 600 kcal/day defined the t-id group.\\tMETHODS\\nprimary end point was insulin sensitivity as evaluated by homa-ir (mainly reflecting hepatic insulin sensitivity) and hyperinsulinemic, isoglycemic clamps (primarily reflecting peripheral insulin sensitivity).\\tMETHODS\\nbody mass decreased in t and d by 5.9 +/- 0.7 and 5.3 +/- 0.7 kg, respectively, whereas t-id and c remained weight stable.\\tRESULTS\\ntotal and abdominal fat mass were reduced in an additive manner in the t-id, d, and t groups by 1.9 +/- 0.3/0.2 +/- 0.1, 4.4 +/- 0.7/0.5 +/- 0.1, and 7.7 +/- 0.8/0.9 +/- 0.1 kg, respectively.\\tRESULTS\\nhoma-ir was improved in t, d, and t-id, whereas insulin-stimulated glucose clearance and suppression of plasma nonesterified fatty acids (nefas) were increased only in the two training groups.\\tRESULTS\\nthus, loss of fat mass (diet or training induced) improves hepatic insulin sensitivity, whereas peripheral insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue is increased by endurance training only.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis demonstrates that endurance training per se increases various metabolic health parameters and that endurance training should preferably always be included in any intervention regimen for improving metabolic health in moderately overweight men.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nalthough adult and late-onset dm1 phenotypes dm1 present distinct lower limb weaknesses portraits, resulting physical limitations have never been described separately for each phenotype.\\tBACKGROUND\\nto characterize the lower limb weaknesses and physical limitations among the dm1 adult and late-onset phenotypes separately and to document the contribution of weaknesses on mobility to optimize the management of this population.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe strength of four muscle groups among 198 participants was quantified.\\tMETHODS\\nparticipants were categorized according to the severity of their muscular involvement using the muscular impairment rating scale (mirs).\\tMETHODS\\nphysical limitations were assessed using the timed up-and-go (tug), berg balance scale (bbs) and 10 meters comfortable walking speed (10mwt).\\tMETHODS\\nmultiple linear regressions were performed to identify the contribution of each muscle group to the mobility tests scores.\\tMETHODS\\nlate-onset demonstrated less weakness and physical limitations (p < 0.001 - 0.002) than the adult phenotype, but 21.9-47.5% of participants with this phenotype showed mobility scores below reference values.\\tRESULTS\\nphysical limitations were observed in the first two mirs grades (37.5-42.1% of the participants) for the tug and 10mwt.\\tRESULTS\\nankle dorsiflexors and knee extensors were the two muscle groups that showed the strongest relationships with mobility scores.\\tRESULTS\\nalthough less impaired, the late-onset phenotype shows significant lower limb muscle weakness associated with physical limitations.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe surprising presence of quantitative lower limb muscle weakness in the first two mirs grades needs to be considered when using this scale.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nboth ankle dorsiflexors and knee extensors appear to be good indicators of physical limitations in dm1.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe risk of drowning is reported to be 15-19 times greater in people with epilepsy compared to the general population.\\tBACKGROUND\\ndespite this disproportionate burden, there is limited data about the circumstances surrounding drowning deaths in people with epilepsy.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis population-based case series characterizes drowning deaths in people with epilepsy.\\tOBJECTIVE\\npostmortem data from coroner-ordered autopsies conducted in ontario between 2014 and 2016 were screened for cases of drowning in people with a history of seizures.\\tMETHODS\\ndemographic information, epilepsy characteristics, and circumstances surrounding death were extracted from post mortem reports.\\tMETHODS\\nthe incidence of drowning in people with epilepsy was calculated using government estimates of the ontario population and the number of people with epilepsy.\\tMETHODS\\ntwenty-five people with epilepsy drowned during the three-year study period, giving an estimated incidence of 1.5 per 10,000 epilepsy person-years (95% ci: 0.98, 2.23).\\tRESULTS\\ndecedents were mostly young (mean age 36 years) and without physical or developmental disability.\\tRESULTS\\napproximately one-third had psychiatric comorbidities.\\tRESULTS\\nepilepsy severity ranged from well-controlled to drug refractory.\\tRESULTS\\nonly 3 people had alcohol or illicit drugs detected on toxicological analysis.\\tRESULTS\\nforty-four percent of deaths were the result of an unwitnessed drowning in a bathtub.\\tRESULTS\\nthis population-based case series confirms people with epilepsy drown at a rate nearly ten times greater than the general population (1.5 per 10,000 epilepsy person-years compared to the estimated provincial average of 0.13 per 10,000).\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ndrowning deaths in people with epilepsy most often occur in the bathtub.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthese deaths are only rarely associated with intoxication.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\npeople with epilepsy should receive counseling on the increased risk of drowning, including information regarding the significant risk associated with bathtub use, the potential protective roles of anti-epileptic drug (aed) adherence and supervision when in or around water, and the fact that all people with epilepsy remain at an increased risk of drowning regardless of their apparent seizure control.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe success of long-term electrophysiological recordings often depends on the quality of the implantation surgery.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhere we provide useful information for surgeons who are learning the process of implanting electrode systems.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nwe demonstrate the implantation procedure of both a penetrating and a surface electrode.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe surgical process is described from start to finish, including detailed descriptions of each step throughout the procedure.\\tMETHODS\\nit should also be noted that this video guide is focused towards procedures conducted in rodent models and other small animal models.\\tMETHODS\\nmodifications of the described procedures are feasible for other animal models.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) has been associated with exposures in so-called \\'electrical occupations\\'.\\tBACKGROUND\\nit is unclear if this possible link may be explained by exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (elf-mf) or by electrical shocks.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe evaluated als mortality in 2000-2008 and exposure to elf-mf and electrical shocks in the swiss national cohort, using job exposure matrices for occupations at censuses 1990 and 2000.\\tMETHODS\\nwe compared 2.2 million workers with high or medium vs. low exposure to elf-mf and electrical shocks using cox proportional hazard models.\\tMETHODS\\nresults showed that mortality from als was higher in people who had medium or high elf-mf exposure in both censuses (hr 1.55 (95% ci 1.11-2.15)), but closer to unity for electrical shocks (hr 1.17 (95% ci 0.83-1.65)).\\tRESULTS\\nwhen both exposures were included in the same model, the hr for elf-mf changed little (hr 1.56), but the hr for electric shocks was attenuated to 0.97.\\tRESULTS\\nin conclusion, there was an association between exposure to elf-mf and mortality from als among workers with a higher likelihood of long-term exposure.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn) of the hypothalamus is a multioscillator system that drives daily rhythms in mammalian behavior and physiology.\\tBACKGROUND\\nbased on recent data implicating vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (vip) as the key intercellular synchronizing agent, we developed a multicellular scn model to investigate the effects of cellular heterogeneity and intercellular connectivity on circadian behavior.\\tOBJECTIVE\\na 2-dimensional grid was populated with 400 model cells that were heterogeneous with respect to their uncoupled rhythmic behavior (intrinsic and damped pacemakers with a range of oscillation periods) and vip release characteristics (vip producers and nonproducers).\\tMETHODS\\nwe constructed small-world network architectures in which local connections between vip producing cells and their 4 nearest neighbors were augmented with random connections, resulting in long-range coupling across the grid.\\tMETHODS\\nwith only 10% of the total possible connections, the small-world network model was able to produce similar phase synchronization indices as a mean-field model with vip producing cells connected to all other cells.\\tRESULTS\\npartial removal of random connections decreased the synchrony among neurons, the amplitude of vip and camp response element binding protein oscillations, the mean period of intrinsic periods across the population, and the percentage of oscillating cells.\\tRESULTS\\nthese results indicate that small-world connectivity provides the optimal compromise between the number of connections and control of circadian amplitude and synchrony.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis model predicts that small decreases in long-range vip connections in the scn could have dramatic effects on period and amplitude of daily rhythms, features commonly described with aging.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nzika virus (zikv) is linked to deleterious foetal and neonate outcomes.\\tBACKGROUND\\nmaternal exposure to zikv through mosquitoes and sexual

attitudes and access to zikv prevention among 180 adults in american samoan public health clinics.\\tMETHODS\\nit queried knowledge about pre-natal care, protection against mosquitoes and condom use.\\tMETHODS\\nwomen were most likely to identify pre-natal care as important.\\tRESULTS\\nthe majority of participants were able to identify how to prevent mosquito bites, but may have been unable to follow through due to socioeconomic and infrastructure limitations.\\tRESULTS\\nfew participants identified condom use as a preventative measure against zikv.\\tRESULTS\\nprevention misconceptions were most pronounced in women of low socioeconomic status.\\tRESULTS\\nthese findings reinforce the need for a multi-pronged approach to zikv.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis study highlights the need for

issues.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nuniform mesoporous tio(2) nanospheres were successfully developed via an interfacial confined formation process for application in dye-sensitized solar cells.\\tMETHODS\\nthe mesoporous spherical structures greatly promote the dye-loading capacity, electron transfer, and light scattering, resulting in remarkable enhancement of the cell performance.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe designed interfacial platform caused a reaction-limited aggregation of the tio(2) nanocrystals, resulting in the formation of mesoporous spherical nanostructures with sphere diameter of 216 nm and pore size of 8 nm.\\tRESULTS\\nthe oriented attachment of adjacent tio(2) nanocrystals facilitated the electron transfer process when the mesoporous tio(2) nanospheres were used as electrode films.\\tRESULTS\\nthe dye coverage was enhanced remarkably in the mesoporous spherical tio(2) samples.\\tRESULTS\\nowing to the enhanced light-harvesting efficiency, solar conversion efficiency was enhanced about 30% for the dye-sensitized solar cell (dssc) based on mesoporous spherical tio(2) in comparison with that made by commercial tio(2) nanoparticles.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nfocal segmental glomerulosclerosis (fsgs) is a heterogeneous clinicopathological entity.\\tBACKGROUND\\ntwo frameworks for the classification of fsgs have been described: etiologic and morphologic.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe etiologic classification is distinguished among genetic, adaptive, virus-associated, drug-induced, and idiopathic types.\\tBACKGROUND\\nmorphologic classification is commonly referred to as the columbia classification published in 2004, which distinguishes five variants: collapsing, tip, cellular, perihilar, and not otherwise specified (nos).\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis classification is based on light microscopic patterns with rigorously defined specific criteria, which can be applied to primary and secondary forms of fsgs, and has been widely used over the past 10 years both as a diagnostic and as a prognostic clinical tool.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis paper defines common histopathological features of fsgs, distinguished characters among five variants, and points out the confusion about terminology of variants, because most were proposed in the past with different definitions.\\tOBJECTIVE\\ndespite good interobserver reproducibility of this classification system, difficulty in its application may arise in the interpretation of lesions with mixed features of more than one variant in the same tissue specimen and with late lesions, because other variants may evolve into the nos variant over time.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nemphysematous destruction of lung parenchyma visible in computed tomography (ct) can be attributed to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) or to alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (aatd).\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe evaluated if visual semiquantitative phenotyping of ct data helps identifying individuals with aatd in a group of smokers with severe emphysema and airflow limitation.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nn = 14 patients with aatd and n = 15 with copd and a minimum of 10 pack years underwent ct, clinical assessment, and full-body plethysmography.\\tMETHODS\\nthe extent and type of emphysema as well as large and small airway changes were rated semiquantitatively for each lobe using a standardized previously published scoring system.\\tMETHODS\\nlastly, a final diagnosis for each patient was proposed.\\tMETHODS\\naatd had a significantly lower mean emphysema score than copd, with 8.9 +/- 3.4 versus 11.9 +/- 3.2 (p < 0.001), respectively.\\tRESULTS\\nwithin both groups, there was significantly more emphysema in the lower lobes (p < 0.05-0.001).\\tRESULTS\\nthe copd group showed an upper- and middle-lobe predominance of emphysema distribution when compared to the aatd group (p < 0.001).\\tRESULTS\\ncentrilobular (cle) and panlobular (ple) emphysema patterns showed a uniform distribution within both groups, with a cle predominance in the upper lung and a ple predominance in the lower lung regions.\\tRESULTS\\naatd and copd both showed significantly more airway changes in lower lobes compared to upper lobes (p = 0.05-0.001), without significant differences between both groups.\\tRESULTS\\nthe typical emphysema distribution patterns seen on ct traditionally assigned to aatd and copd were of little use in discriminating both entities.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nalso, airway changes could not contribute to a more precise differentiation.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nwe conclude that a concise standardized phenotyping-driven approach to chest ct in emphysema is not sufficient to identify patients with aatd in a cohort of smokers with advanced emphysema.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nin 2013, we reported a case of combined anterior and posterior reconstruction after three-level en bloc vertebral body replacement and replacement of the aorta for chondrosarcoma of the thoracic spine.\\tBACKGROUND\\neight years after, we observed an implant

is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in gastrointestinal surgery.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe serosal aspect of staple lines is commonly observed for integrity, but the mucosal surface and state of mucosa after firing is less often inspected.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe sought to assess the degree of mucosal capture when using stapling devices and determine whether incomplete capture influences staple line integrity.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nporcine ileum was transected in vivo and staple lines were collected and rated for degree of mucosal capture on a 5-point scale from 1 (mucosa mainly captured on both sides) to 5 (majority of mucosa not captured).\\tMETHODS\\nmucosal capture was also assessed in ex vivo staple lines, and fluid leakage pressure and location of first leak was assessed.\\tMETHODS\\nstapling devices studied were echelon flex gst with 60-mm blue (gst60b) and green (gst60g) cartridges, and medtronic endogia universal with tri-staple technology with 60 mm medium (egia60amt) reloads (purple).\\tMETHODS\\ngst60b and gst60g staple lines produced significantly better mucosal capture scores than the egia60amt staple lines (p < 0.001, in all tests).\\tRESULTS\\ncompared to egia60amt, leak pressures were 39% higher for gst60b (p < 0.001) and 23% higher for gst60g (p = 0.022).\\tRESULTS\\ninitial staple line leak site was associated with incomplete mucosal capture 78% of the time.\\tRESULTS\\nthere are differences in degree of mucosal capture between commercial staplers, and the devices that produce better mucosal capture had significantly higher leak pressures.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nfurther research is needed to determine the significance of these findings on staple line healing throughout the postoperative period.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe aim of this retrospective study was to determine the effect of skeletal muscle and body fat on liver function in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) diagnosed by liver biopsy.\\tOBJECTIVE\\namong the 219 patients with nafld enrolled in this study was a cohort of 139 patients who had their body composition measured with inbody720 at baseline and at >/= 1 year postbaseline, to elucidate the relationship between liver function and changes in skeletal muscle and body fat mass.\\tMETHODS\\nmultivariate analysis was used to identify factors influencing low skeletal muscle mass index (smi, defined as 7 kg/m(2) in men, and 5.7 kg/m(2) in women) and the skeletal muscle mass to body fat mass ratio (sf ratio).\\tMETHODS\\nof the 219 patients enrolled, 27 (12.3%) had a low smi.\\tRESULTS\\npatient age (> 70 years) and female gender were identified as risk factors for low smi.\\tRESULTS\\nhepatic fibrosis was not associated with smi.\\tRESULTS\\nin the cohort followed up at baseline and 12 months later, transaminase activity, body fat mass, and smi significantly decreased over time.\\tRESULTS\\nchanges in the sf ratio were significantly associated with changes in liver function.\\tRESULTS\\nan increase in the sf ratio [hazard ratio (hr) 10.99 in men, 6.849 in women] was a predictor of reduced alt, independent of age and other backgrounds.\\tRESULTS\\nin the patients with nafld, smi was decreased, even in the early stages of nafld.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ntherapeutic strategies for nafld require a reduction in body fat mass and the maintenance of skeletal muscle is also needed.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ncaffeine is a widely used ergogenic aid with most research suggesting it confers the greatest effects during endurance activities.\\tBACKGROUND\\ndespite the growing body of literature around the use of caffeine as an ergogenic aid, there are few recent meta-analyses that quantitatively assess the effect of caffeine on endurance exercise.\\tBACKGROUND\\nto summarise studies that have investigated the ergogenic effects of caffeine on endurance time-trial performance and to quantitatively analyse the results of these studies to gain a better understanding of the magnitude of the ergogenic effect of caffeine on endurance time-trial performance.\\tOBJECTIVE\\na systematic review was carried out on randomised placebo-controlled studies investigating the effects of caffeine on endurance performance and a meta-analysis was conducted to determine the ergogenic effect of caffeine on endurance time-trial performance.\\tMETHODS\\nforty-six studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis.\\tMETHODS\\ncaffeine has a small but evident effect on endurance performance when taken in moderate doses (3-6 mg/kg) as well as an overall improvement following caffeine compared to placebo in mean power output (3.03 +/- 3.07%; effect size = 0.23 +/- 0.15) and time-trial completion time (2.22 +/- 2.59%; effect size = 0.41 +/- 0.2).\\tRESULTS\\nhowever, differences in responses to caffeine ingestion have been shown, with two studies reporting slower time-trial performance, while five studies reported lower mean power output during the time-trial.\\tRESULTS\\ncaffeine can be used effectively as an ergogenic aid when taken in moderate doses, such as during sports when a small increase in endurance performance can lead to significant differences in placements as athletes are often separated by small margins.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nrecent treatment studies with cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (cbt-i) have demonstrated effects on both sleep problems and depression.\\tBACKGROUND\\ntwo previous studies have indicated that the beneficial effect from cbt-i on depression may come through improved sleep, although insomnia severity during treatment had not previously been investigated as a mediator.\\tBACKGROUND\\nour aim was to investigate if insomnia

demonstrated a significant reciprocal relationship between insomnia severity and depressive severity throughout cbt-i, although mid-treatment insomnia had a stronger effect on depression than mid-treatment depression had on insomnia.\\tRESULTS\\nthe results were similar for both post-treatment and follow-up.\\tRESULTS\\nsome improvement in depressive severity after cbt-i is explained by improved sleep.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe findings emphasize the importance of making comorbid insomnia a treatment focus in its own right.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nhealth activists often see the uptake of

in older individuals.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthese findings stress the continuous nature of the heart-brain axis in the development of cognitive impairment.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ntreatments for metastatic pancreatic cancer include monotherapy with gemcitabine (gem); combinations of gem with oxaliplatin (ox + gem), cisplatin (cis + gem), capecitabine (cap + gem), or nab-paclitaxel (nab-p + gem); and the

effectiveness of the 2 techniques in horizontal ridge augmentation, they could also result in severe complications, which is thus considered a contraindication.\\tBACKGROUND\\na modification of the bone splitting and the osteotome techniques is proposed hereby as an alternative.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe modified procedure reduces the tension of labial bone plate by creating a partial bone fracture at the most depressed area of labial defect where the thinner bone exists.\\tRESULTS\\nthis technique is primarily useful for cases with a facial concavity.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe modification could prevent iatrogenic labial bone defect during the surgery, and compared with onlay bone grafting, it may shorten the overall treatment time and avoid traumatizing the bone donor site.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nfiji has undergone an epidemiological transition, characterised by declining infectious disease and childhood mortality, that has been offset by rising cardiovascular disease mortality.\\tBACKGROUND\\nother

decreased, but remains relatively high in men compared to many developed countries.\\tRESULTS\\nt2dm and hypertension trends, and cvd consequences related to diet, exercise and tobacco smoking, have placed the fiji population in a variant of the epidemiological transition manifesting as a plateau in life expectancy similar to that of numerous developed countries during the mid-20th century.\\tRESULTS\\nthere is evidence that risk factors and consequent cvd mortality can be reduced in populations.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nobesity and t2dm reductions have been observed only in populations surviving in dire circumstances.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ninterventions to lower the prevalence of cvd and t2dm risk factors in the fiji population require multi-faceted approaches, with continual monitoring

mobile mammography screening and the relationships between prior mammograms and recall rates.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe frequency of incomplete mammogram reports, the subgroups of those needing prior comparison mammograms, recalls for additional imaging, and availability of prior mammograms of a mobile screening mammography unit were compared with fixed site mammography from january 1, 2007 through december 31, 2009.\\tMETHODS\\nall mobile unit mammograms were full field digital mammography (ffdm).\\tMETHODS\\ndifferences between rates of recall, incomplete reports, and availability of prior mammograms were calculated using the chi-square statistic.\\tMETHODS\\nof 2640 mobile mammography cases, 21.9% (578) reports were incomplete, versus 15.2% (7653) (p </= 0.001) of 50325 fixed

essential trace element selenium and polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) have been used for the prevention of cancer.\\tBACKGROUND\\nboth nutrients enhance the apoptosis of malignant cells and provide health benefits.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever, an increased dietary intake of pufa augments the susceptibility of lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage in many cells.\\tBACKGROUND\\nso far, relatively few data are available about the interaction of selenium and pufa in testis and thus a possible effect of both dietary components on the prevention of testicular cancer or on the apoptosis of testicular germ cells.\\tBACKGROUND\\nmale germ cells in the rat contain most of the testicular phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (phgpx), mainly as the mitochondrial isoform of this selenoprotein (m-phgpx).\\tBACKGROUND\\nan experiment was therefore carried out to determine the action of fish oil, a nutrient rich in pufa, on the testicular expression of phgpx.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nbecause the phgpx formation remains nearly unchanged in the animals fed the pufa-enriched diet, we conclude that no apoptosis of testicular germ cells is induced by an increased intake of this nutrient.\\tRESULTS\\nthe intake of fish oil in the selenium-deficient animal led to a markedly altered formation of several selenium-containing proteins, including sperm nuclei glutathione peroxidase (sngpx), also designated as the nuclear form of phgpx (n-phgpx), and a 10-kda selenium-containing protein.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis commentary summarizes the experience and

cancer-specific survival (css) rate than the low conut group (39.3 vs. 55.5%, p < 0.001).\\tRESULTS\\nhigh conut score was significantly associated with larger tumor size, more lymph node metastasis, and poorer nutritional status, including lower body mass index (bmi), higher prognostic nutritional index (pni) and the presence of preoperative anemia (all p < 0.05).\\tRESULTS\\nmultivariate analysis revealed that conut score was an independent prognostic factor (hr: 1.553; 95% ci: 1.080-2.232; p = 0.017).\\tRESULTS\\nof note, in the low pni group, conut score still effectively stratified css (p = 0.016).\\tRESULTS\\nfurthermore, the prognostic significance of conut score was also maintained when stratified by tnm stage (all p < 0.05).\\tRESULTS\\nconut score is considered a useful nutritional marker for predicting prognosis in stage ii-iii gc patients undergoing curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, and may help to facilitate the planning of preoperative nutritional interventions.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nadaptation of bacterial pathogens to an intracellular environment requires resetting of the expression levels of a wide range of both virulence and housekeeping genes.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe investigated the possibility that changes in dna supercoiling could modulate the expression of genes known to be important in the intracellular growth of the pathogen salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nour data show that dna becomes relaxed when salmonella grows in murine macrophage but not in epithelial cells, indicating that dna supercoiling plays a role in discrimination between two types of intracellular environment.\\tRESULTS\\nthe ssra regulatory gene within the spi-2 pathogenicity island that is required for survival in macrophage was found to be upregulated by dna relaxation.\\tRESULTS\\nthis enhancement of expression also required the fis nucleoid-associated protein.\\tRESULTS\\nmanipulating the level of the fis protein

virulence gene expression.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis study sought to validate exercise capacity (ec) as a surrogate for mortality, hospitalization, and health-related quality of life (hrqol).\\tOBJECTIVE\\nec is often used as a primary outcome in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (cr) trials of heart failure (hf) via direct cardiorespiratory assessment of maximum oxygen uptake (vo2peak) or through submaximal tests, such as the 6-min walk test (6mwt).\\tBACKGROUND\\nafter a systematic review, 31 randomized trials of exercise-based cr compared with no exercise control (4,784 hf patients) were included.\\tMETHODS\\noutcomes were pooled using random effects meta-analyses, and inverse variance weighted linear regression equations were fitted to estimate the relationship between the cr on ec and all-cause mortality, hospitalization, and hrqol.\\tMETHODS\\nspearman correlation coefficient (rho), r(2) at trial level, and surrogate threshold effect (ste) were

effects on ec measured through vo2peak (+3.10 ml/kg/min; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 2.01 to 4.20) or 6mwt (+41.15 m; 95% ci: 16.68 to 65.63) compared to control.\\tRESULTS\\nthe analyses showed a low level of association between improvements in ec (vo2peak or 6mwt) and mortality and hospitalization.\\tRESULTS\\nmoderate levels of correlation between ec with hrqol were seen (e.g., r(2) <52%;\\tRESULTS\\nestimated ste was an increase of 5 ml/kg/min for vo2peak and 80 m for 6mwt to predict a significant improvement in hrqol.\\tRESULTS\\nthe study results indicate that ec is a poor

reported to result in a less favorable outcome with high primary failure and recurrence rates.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe real bump site cannot always be precisely reapproached under fluoroscopy so physicians can perform ablation to a location different from where the mechanical block was encountered.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin this paper, we describe this novel use of a 3-dimensional (3d) mapping system (playback ablation) with a case series.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe ensite velocity system (st. jude medical, st. paul, mn, usa), a 3d mapping system, has a unique function that records the positional information of catheters in a 3d geometric map and the local potential of catheters continuously.\\tMETHODS\\nthis function enables physicians to specify the bump site in a 3d geometric map and apply ablation to the bump site even if the catheter moves away from the bump site.\\tMETHODS\\nthis technique helped us eliminate aps in two patients with bump of aps, and they have been free of preexcitation and arrhythmias without the use of anti-arrhythmic drugs for more than 3 months.\\tRESULTS\\nthis technique may contribute to improving long-term success in patients with mechanical block of

genetically distinct from the currently circulating endemic variants.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis study warrants further investigations into molecular epidemiology and genetic evolution of the pedv in thailand.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nwe experimentally study the effects of a uniform electric field on the conformation of single dna molecules.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nwe demonstrate that a moderate electric field (~200 v/cm) strongly compresses isolated dna polymer coils into isotropic globules.\\tRESULTS\\ninsight into the nature of these compressed states is gained by following the expansion of the molecules back

slower expansion characterized by two long-lived metastable states.\\tRESULTS\\nfluorescence microscopy and stretching experiments reveal that the metastable states are the result of intramolecular self-entanglements induced by the electric field.\\tRESULTS\\nthese results have broad importance in dna separations and single molecule genomics, polymer rheology, and dna-based nanofabrication.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nto demonstrate the possibilities of differential diagnostics of dsm with hc using modern instrumental diagnostic methods.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe study involved two clinical cases of patients with dsm and hc, who underwent comprehensive ophthalmological examination including edi-oct and oct angiography, fluorescent angiography (fa), indocyanine-green angiography (icg) and magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits (mri).\\tMETHODS\\nthe most simple and highly informative method for differential diagnostic of dsm with hc is currently edi-oct.\\tRESULTS\\nin difficult differential diagnostic cases, it is recommended to use fa and mri.\\tRESULTS\\nadditionally, for identification of the cause of srd in dsm, oct-angiography and icg-angiography can be used.\\tRESULTS\\nthus, diagnostics of dsm is difficult today primarily because of the low awareness of ophthalmologists about the presence of such macula pathology.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ndetection of this anatomical feature by means of ophthalmoscopy alone can be difficult and requires special skills and experience.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe use of edi-oct, as well as fa and mri in difficult differential diagnostic cases, and correct interpretation of the obtained data can help avoid diagnostic errors.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nhippocampal mean diffusivity (md) measured by diffusion-tensor imaging is a promising diagnostic marker for mild cognitive impairment (mci) and dementia.\\tBACKGROUND\\nits performance has yet to be evaluated in primary care patients, who vary systematically from patients visiting specialized care settings.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe assessed the diagnostic accuracy of hippocampus diffusivity for detecting mci and dementia in a sample recruited from primary care, compared to a sample from specialized care.\\tOBJECTIVE\\none sample was recruited from a primary care intervention trial (delphi-mv) (n=70), and the other sample was recruited from our memory clinic (n=70).\\tMETHODS\\nthe samples were matched pairwise for diagnosis, mmse, age, gender, and education.\\tMETHODS\\nthey included dementia patients, mci patients and healthy subjects.\\tMETHODS\\nmean md was calculated for the left and right hippocampus, corrected for partial volume effects.\\tMETHODS\\nwithin each sample, left or right hippocampal md served as predictor for diagnostic group in logistic regressions, which were additionally controlled for white matter lesions.\\tMETHODS\\nin the primary care sample, hippocampal md detected dementia with high cross-validated accuracy (left: auc=.92; right: auc=.85), but did not classify mci with an accuracy above chance (left: auc=.58; right: auc=.44).\\tRESULTS\\nin the memory clinic sample, hippocampal md classified both dementia (left: auc=.91; right: auc=.91) and mci (left: auc=.86; right: auc=.83) with high cross-validated accuracy.\\tRESULTS\\nhippocampal md supported the identification of dementia but did not contribute to the detection of mci in the primary care patient population.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nolder adults (50-70 years old) have lower organ donor registration rates than younger adults.\\tBACKGROUND\\nolder adults have different informational needs and donor registration behavior than younger age groups.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe objective of this qualitative study was to understand insights of older adults about organ donation to effectively address the barriers to becoming an organ donor.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthis study identified turning points as \"aha!\" moments that occurred during a dialogue intervention where older adults discussed benefits, barriers, and process to organ donation.\\tOBJECTIVE\\ndialogues were held with small groups of older adults in 11 communities in a midwestern organ procurement organization service area.\\tMETHODS\\nparticipants were positive to organ donation, but not registered as an organ donor.\\tMETHODS\\nmethods/approach: qualitative analysis of verbatim comments from the dialogue and a follow-up survey were used to examine turning points or \"aha!\" moments of participants\\' decision-making about organ donation and organ donor registration.\\tMETHODS\\ntwenty-one separate in-depth dialogues were conducted with 198 participants, with mean age of 60.57 years.\\tRESULTS\\nthere were 2757 separate comments coded with 465 of the comments (17%) identified as providing aha! moments during the dialogue.\\tRESULTS\\nthree themes include benefits of organ donation (30%), barriers about organ donation (39%), and organ donation process (31%).\\tRESULTS\\nthe research identified moments in the dialogue where possible learning about organ donation may have occurred.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nafter participation in the dialogue process, there was an increase in intent to register to be an organ donor, organ donation discussion with family and friends, and organ donor registration.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nintensified treatment of head and neck cancers (hnc): by radiotherapy (rth) commonly combined with cytotoxic drugs is associated with oral mucositis (om).\\tBACKGROUND\\nchanges in the functioning of nucleotide synthesis pathway (rnr1, coded by rrm1 gene) can modulate the efficiency of cellular dna repair mechanisms and influence the risk of occurrence and severity of om in hnc patients after rth.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation between expression of rrm1 gene measured in free circulating rna (cfrna) and the risk of more severe om and disease-free survival (dfs) and overall survival (os) in patients undergoing rth for hnc.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe study included 60 patients treated with rth for hnc.\\tMETHODS\\nrrm1 gene expression was examined in circulating rna isolated from peripheral blood plasma (before treatment).\\tMETHODS\\nhigh rrm1 gene expression was significantly associated with higher risk of grade 3 om after 5 (or = 4.97), 6 (or = 4.33) and 7 (or = 3.50) weeks of rth.\\tRESULTS\\nexpression of rrm1 gene was not significantly related with risk of dfs and os shortening (however well separated kaplan-meier curves might suggest its potential prognostic impact).\\tRESULTS\\nthe evaluation of rrm1 gene expression in cfrna allows for estimation of the risk of severe om in patients subjected to rth.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ndendrite morphology is pivotal for neural circuitry functioning.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwhile the causative relationship between small-scale dendrite morphological abnormalities (shape, density of dendritic spines) and neurodevelopmental disorders is well established, such relationship remains elusive for larger-scale dendrite morphological impairments (size, shape, branching pattern of dendritic trees).\\tBACKGROUND\\nhere, we summarize published data on dendrite morphological irregularities in human patients and animal models for neurodevelopmental disorders, with focus on autism and schizophrenia.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nwe next discuss high-risk genes for these disorders and their role in dendrite morphogenesis.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nwe finally overview recent developments in therapeutic attempts and we discuss how they relate to dendrite morphology.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nwe find that both autism and schizophrenia are accompanied by dendritic arbor morphological irregularities, and that majority of their high-risk genes regulate dendrite morphogenesis.\\tRESULTS\\nthus, we present a compelling argument that, along with smaller-scale morphological impairments in dendrites (spines and synapse), irregularities in larger-scale dendrite morphology (arbor shape, size) may be an important part of neurodevelopmental disorders\\' etiology.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nwe suggest that this should not be ignored when developing future therapeutic treatments.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nflow cytometric immunophenotyping is considered an indispensable tool for the diagnosis, classification and monitoring of disease in monoclonal gammopathies.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe clinical sensitivity of flow cytometry is comparable with advanced molecular methods.\\tBACKGROUND\\nclinical application of flow cytometry in monoclonal gammopathies has various dimensions, such as differential diagnosis of malignant plasma cell disorder from reactive plasmacytosis, identifying the progression risk in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (mgus) and asymptomatic multiple myeloma (mm), and minimal residual disease detection.\\tBACKGROUND\\nflow cytometry-based clonality assessment with immunophenotyping encourages and enables the most stringent method of diagnosis and follow-up.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe objective of this review is to update the malignant plasma cells phenotypic profile of mgus and mm.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe most comprehensive antigens, such as cd19, cd27, cd28, cd45, cd56 and cd117, play a significant role in the characterization of normal and malignant plasma cells.\\tRESULTS\\nseveral research groups described the putative phenotype of myeloma cell progenitors, but no remarkable suggestion could be made because of disparity.\\tRESULTS\\nthis review also focuses on the association of malignant phenotypic markers and chromosomal aberrations that identify the specific prognostic features in monoclonal gammopathies.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe purpose of this study was to assess the role of remote magnetic navigation (rmn) in the ablation of ventricular premature complexes (vpcs) arising from outflow tracts (ot) and valve annuli by comparing to manual control navigation (mcn).\\tOBJECTIVE\\na total of 152 patients with frequent vpcs were prospectively enrolled.\\tMETHODS\\n64 (42%) patients underwent ablation guided by rmn.\\tMETHODS\\nacute success rate was defined as the complete elimination and non-inducibility of clinical vpcs during the procedure.\\tMETHODS\\noverall, acute success rate of rmn group was not different from mcn group (87.5% vs 84.1%, p=0.56).\\tRESULTS\\ncompared to mcn group, the fluoroscopic time of ot-vpcs ablation in the rmn group was significantly reduced by 67% (2.9+/-2.3min vs 8.9+/-9.7min, p=0.006), and the ablation applications in successful cases were significantly reduced (11+/-7 vs 15+/-11, p=0.018).\\tRESULTS\\ncompared to mcn, rmn significantly decreased ablation applications (15+/-9 vs 23+/-9, p=0.013) in the acute success rates of ablating vpcs of valve annulus, and has a trend of a higher success rate for vpcs arising from tricuspid annulus (10/11 vs 7/12, p=0.193).\\tRESULTS\\nno complications occurred in the rmn group.\\tRESULTS\\nthree cases of cardiac tamponade and one case of transient atrioventricular block occurred in the mcn group (p=0.22).\\tRESULTS\\nafter a mean follow up of 16.2months, 2/56 and 3/74 patients had a recurrence of vpcs in the rmn group and mcn group respectively (p=0.75).\\tRESULTS\\nwhen compared to mcn, rmn-guided ablation for vpcs was just as effective and safe, with the added benefit of reduced fluoroscopic time and fewer ablation applications.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe in vitro effects of polyalkyl-imide hydrogel (pai) containing 96% pyrogen-free water on the viability, apoptosis, cell shape and metabolic activities of murine 3t3 and human detroit 555 fibroblasts were investigated.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nanalysis of the viscous-elastic properties and the ultrastructure of pai, performed by rheometer and afm respectively, showed that the material has the typical characteristics of hydrogel, including a three-dimensional configuration of molecules arranged in a regular network with many discrete caveolae where most of the water is captured.\\tRESULTS\\nhydrogel biocompatibility was found to be high for both cell lines, with some differences.\\tRESULTS\\ncell viability decreased more in 3t3 cells than detroit 550 fibroblasts when cultured in the presence of 100 mg/ml hydrogel but not at concentrations of 25 and 50 mg/ml hydrogel.\\tRESULTS\\nthe period of incubation with pai (24 and 48 h) only partially affected cell viability.\\tRESULTS\\napoptosis, most likely due to cells\\' inability to adhere to the polymer, was the only type of cell death observed.\\tRESULTS\\nfibroblasts grown in the presence of polymer were always metabolically active since they continued to synthesize collagen.\\tRESULTS\\nin conclusion, pai hydrogel, even at high concentrations, was biocompatible for both fibroblasts, but in particular for human cells, thus encouraging its use as a dermal filler.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthere is an increasing interest in the medical use of cannabis, particularly in the treatment of chronic pain.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe aim is to evaluate the effects of cannabis use and the associated benefits reported by patients with various chronic pain diagnoses.\\tOBJECTIVE\\na total of 338 patients with different chro- nic pain conditions were treated with a cannabis flos 19% decoction for 12 months, in addition to their pharmacological therapy.\\tMETHODS\\nbaseline levels for pain medications, pain intensity, pain disability, anxiety and depression were recorded at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.\\tMETHODS\\npain intensity records a statistically significant reduction from baseline to 12 months follow up (x(2) 61.375; p<0,001); the im- provements from baseline to 12 months follow up are also recorded in pain disability (x(2) 39.423; p<0,001) and in anxiety and depression symptoms (x(2)30.362; p<0,001; x(2)27.786; p<0,001).\\tRESULTS\\nour study suggest that cannabis therapy, as an adjun- ct a traditional analgesic therapy, can be an efficacious tool to make more effective the management of chronic pain and its consequences on functional and psychological dimension.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nfurther randomized, controlled trials are needed to confirm our conclusions.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\naging-associated cognitive impairment is an important health care issue since individuals with mild cognitive impairment are more likely to develop alzheimer\\'s disease.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin the present study, the protective effect of gossypium herbaceam extracts (ghe) on learning and memory impairment associated with aging were examined in vivo using morris water maze and step through task.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nfurthermore, the antioxidant activity and neuroprotective effect of ghe was investigated with methods of histochemistry and biochemistry.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthese data showed that oral administration with ghe at the doses of 35, 70, and 140 mg/kg exerted an improved effect on the learning and memory impairment in aged rats.\\tRESULTS\\nsubsequently, ghe afforded a beneficial action on eradication of free radicals without influence on the activity of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase.\\tRESULTS\\nghe treatment enhanced the expression levels of nerve growth factor.\\tRESULTS\\nmeanwhile, proliferation of neural progenitor cells was elevated in hippocampus after treatment with ghe.\\tRESULTS\\ntaken together, neurogenic niche improvement could be involved in the mechanism underlying neuroprotection of ghe against aging-associated cognitive impairment.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthese findings suggested that ghe might be a potential agent as cognitive-enhancing drugs that delay or halt mild cognitive impairment progression to alzheimer\\'s disease

respectively.\\tMETHODS\\narsenic trioxide significantly inhibited the hl-60 cell proliferation and displayed a good time-dose correlation.\\tRESULTS\\nrt-pcr and western blot showed that the expression of mad2 was up-regulated and the expression of cdc20 was down-regulated in hl-60 cells treated with arsenic trioxide of different concentration (4,8,10 micromol/l).\\tRESULTS\\narsenic trioxide can inhibit the human acute myeloid leukemia hl-60 cell proliferation, and its mechanism may be related with up-regulation of mad2 expression and down-regulation of cdc20 expression.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nescherichia coli survives ph 2 environments through an acid resistance (ar) system regulated by the transcriptional activator gade.\\tBACKGROUND\\nnumerous proteins control gade at an upstream, conserved, 798 bp intergenic region.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe show this region produces three transcripts starting at -124 (t1), -324/-317 (t2) and -566 (t3) bp from the gade start codon.\\tRESULTS\\ntranscriptional lacz fusions to gade promoter regions revealed p1 and p3 were active while p2 alone was not.\\tRESULTS\\nhowever, pairing p3 with p2 activated p2 and increased expression 20-fold above p3 alone.\\tRESULTS\\nthe fusions were transferred to salmonella, which lacks this ar system, and plasmid-borne e. coli-specific regulators evga, ydeo, gade and gadx were introduced.\\tRESULTS\\ndata revealed that ydeo and gadx activate p3, p2 and p3p2, while gade autoactivates p1 and represses p3 and p3p2.\\tRESULTS\\nthe developing model indicates that different signals activate ydeo, gadx, or an mnme-dependent regulator, which stimulate gade transcription from the p3 and p2 promoters.\\tRESULTS\\nonce made, gade activates p1 and represses p3 and p2.\\tRESULTS\\nthe p1 region also enables efficient downstream transcription and translation of the p3 or p2 transcripts.\\tRESULTS\\nevidence indicates the entire 750 bp sensory integration locus is

thickness transplantation, known as penetrating keratoplasty.\\tBACKGROUND\\ncorneal endothelial transplantation has been described using two different techniques: descemet\\'s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (dmek) and descemet\\'s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (dsaek).\\tBACKGROUND\\nboth are still performed worldwide.\\tBACKGROUND\\nto compare the effectiveness and safety of descemet\\'s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (dmek) versus descemet\\'s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (dsaek) for the treatment of corneal endothelial failure in people with fuch\\'s endothelial dystropy (fed) and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (pbk).\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe date of the search was 11 august 2017.\\tMETHODS\\nwe included randomised controlled trials (rcts) and non-randomised paired, contralateral-eye studies in any setting where dmek was compared with dsaek to treat people with corneal endothelial failure.\\tMETHODS\\ntwo review authors independently screened the search results, assessed trial quality and extracted data using the standard methodological procedures expected by cochrane.\\tMETHODS\\nour primary outcome was best corrected visual acuity (bcva) measured in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logmar).\\tMETHODS\\nsecondary outcomes were endothelial cell count, graft rejection, primary graft failure and graft dislocation.\\tMETHODS\\nwe graded the risk of bias of non-randomised studies (nrss) using robins-i.\\tMETHODS\\nwe did not identify any rcts but found four non-randomised studies (nrss) including 72 participants (144 eyes), who had received dsaek in the first eye followed by dmek in the fellow eye.\\tRESULTS\\nall the studies included adult participants where there was evidence of fed and endothelial failure requiring a corneal transplant for the treatment of visual impairment.\\tRESULTS\\nwe did not find any studies that included pbk.\\tRESULTS\\nthe trials were published between 2011 and 2015, and we assessed them as high risk of bias due to potential unknown confounding factors since dsaek preceded dmek in all participants.\\tRESULTS\\ntwo studies reported results at 12 months, one at 6 months, and one between 6 and 24 months.\\tRESULTS\\nat one year, using dmek in cases of endothelial failure may result in better bcva compared with dsaek (mean difference (md) -0.14, 95% confidence interval (ci) -0.18 to -0.10 logmar, 4 studies, 140 eyes, low-certainty evidence).\\tRESULTS\\nnone of the participants had severe visual loss (bcva of 1.0 logmar or more; very low-certainty evidence).\\tRESULTS\\nregarding endothelial cell count data (4 studies, 134 eyes) it is hard to draw any conclusions since two studies suggested no difference and the other two reported that dmek provides a higher cell density at one year (very low-certainty evidence).\\tRESULTS\\nno primary graft failure and only one graft rejection were recorded over four studies (144 eyes) (very low-certainty evidence).\\tRESULTS\\nthe most common complications reported were graft dislocations, which were recorded in one or two out of 100 participants with dsaek but were more common using dmek, although this difference could not be precisely estimated (risk ratio (rr) 5.40, 95% ci 1.51 to 19.3; 4 studies, 144 eyes, very low-certainty evidence).\\tRESULTS\\nthis review included studies conducted on people with corneal endothelium failure due to fed for whom both dmek and dsaek can be considered, and found low-certainty evidence that dmek provides some advantage in terms of final bcva, at the cost of more graft dislocations needing \\'re-bubbling\\' (very low-certainty of evidence).\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nchilaiditi\\'s sign is defined as the interposition of bowels between the liver

western blot.\\tMETHODS\\nafter transfecting the oci-ly3 cells by nsd2-shrna for 72 h, the expressions of nsd2 mrna and protein both were down-regulated(p<0.05), the proliferation rate of cells in nsd2 shrna group was significantly lower than that in control and neg shrna groups (p<0.05); the apoptosis rate of cells in nsd2 shrna group was significantly higher than that in control and neg-shrna group (30.37+/-4.22)% vs 1.36+/-0.52 % and 2.17+/-1.43)%(p<0.05); the expressions of bax and caspase-3 were up-regulated, while the expression of bcl-2 was down-regulated; the h3k36me2 level significantly decreased as compared with control group, no obvious decrease of the total protein level of akt was found, but the expressions of p-akt, p-mtor and p-70s6k were down-regulated.\\tRESULTS\\nthe silencing nsd2 gene can inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of oci-ly3 cells, their mechanisms may relate with regulating the h3k36me2 level,

central part of nursing practice.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever, literature shows that professional integrity can be absent and where this is present it can face challenges.\\tBACKGROUND\\ngovernmental inquiries have revealed deficits in the expression of nursing values which underpin professional integrity, in particular caring, compassionate and competent practice that maintains the dignity of patients.\\tBACKGROUND\\nevidence also suggests that it cannot be taken for granted that pre-registration education will have a positive impact on student nurses\\' ability to practice with integrity.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis research explored students\\', mentors\\' and lecturers\\' experiences of professional integrity in pre-registration nurse education.\\tOBJECTIVE\\na grounded theory approach was informed by the work of charmaz (2004, 2006).\\tMETHODS\\nthe study, which took place in a uk university, involved four fields of nursing practice: adult, children, mental health and learning disabilities.\\tMETHODS\\n12 student nurses, 5 practice-based mentors and 6 lecturers participated.\\tMETHODS\\nsemi-structured interviews and focus groups revealed three main themes: meanings, enactment and growth of professional integrity.\\tRESULTS\\npre-registration education can influence the growth of professional integrity by improving students\\' understanding of the boundaries of nursing practice and potential threats to these, skills to speak up on behalf of patients, and knowledge of the processes involved in raising concerns about practice and potential barriers to this.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe proactive development of student nurses\\' strategies to cope, alongside increasing their understanding of the importance of this is also likely to be beneficial.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\naim was to develop a full automatic clustering approach of the time-activity curves (tac) from dynamic 18f-fet pet and evaluate its association with idh1 mutation status and survival in patients with gliomas.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthirty-seven patients (mean age: 45+/-13 y) with newly diagnosed gliomas and dynamic 18f-fet pet before any histopathologic investigation or treatment were retrospectively included.\\tMETHODS\\neach dynamic 18f-fet pet was realigned to the first image and spatially normalized in the montreal neurological institute template.\\tMETHODS\\na tumor mask was semi-automatically generated from z-score maps.\\tMETHODS\\neach brain tumor voxel was clustered in one of the 3 following centroids using dynamic time warping and k-means clustering (centroid #1: slowly increasing slope; centroid #2: rapidly increasing followed by slowly decreasing slope; and centroid #3: rapidly increasing followed by rapidly decreasing slope).\\tMETHODS\\nthe percentage of each dynamic 18f-fet tac within tumors and other conventional 18f-fet pet parameters (maximum and mean tumor-to-brain ratios [tbrmax and tbrmean], time-to-peak [ttp] and slope) was compared between wild-type and idh1 mutant tumors.\\tMETHODS\\ntheir prognostic value was assessed in terms of progression free-survival (pfs) and overall survival (os) by kaplan-meier estimates.\\tMETHODS\\ntwenty patients were idh1 wild-type and 17 idh1 mutant.\\tRESULTS\\nhigher percentage of centroid #1 and centroid #3 within tumors were positively (p = 0.016) and negatively (p = 0.01) correlated with idh1 mutated status.\\tRESULTS\\nalso, tbrmax, tbrmean, ttp, and slope discriminated significantly between tumors with and without idh1 mutation (p range 0.01 to 0.04).\\tRESULTS\\nprogression occurred in 22 patients (59%) at a median of 13.1 months (7.6-37.6 months) and 13 patients (35%) died from tumor progression.\\tRESULTS\\npatients with a percentage of centroid #1 > 90% had a longer survival compared with those with a percentage of centroid #1 < 90% (p = 0.003 for pfs and p = 0.028 for os).\\tRESULTS\\nthis remained significant after stratification on idh1 mutation status (p = 0.029 for pfs and p = 0.034 for os).\\tRESULTS\\ncompared to other conventional 18f-fet pet parameters, ttp and slope were associated with pfs and os (p range 0.009 to 0.04).\\tRESULTS\\nbased on dynamic 18f-fet pet acquisition, we developed a full automatic clustering approach of tac which appears to be a valuable noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic marker in patients with gliomas.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nin this pilot study, the purpose is to investigate if a series of sphenopalatine ganglion (spg) blockade treatments modulate the functional connectivity within the salience and central executive network (cen) in chronic migraine with medication overuse headaches (cm(w/moh) ).\\tOBJECTIVE\\nusing intranasal local anesthesia to block the spg for the treatment of various headache disorders has been employed in clinical practice since the early 1900s.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever, the exact mechanism of how spg modulate resting state intrinsic functional brain networks connectivity remains to be elucidated.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis pilot study seeks to understand the resting state connectivity changes in salience and cens, with emphasis on the mesocorticolimbic systems, before and after a series of spg block treatments.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nusing fmri, resting state connectivity was derived from predefined networks of nodes (regions of interests) for the salience (27 nodes, 351 connections) and cens (17 nodes, 136 connections).\\tMETHODS\\nafter treatments, a paired samples t-test (with 10,000 permutations to correct for multiple comparison) was used to evaluate changes in the intranetwork resting state functional connectivity within the salience and executive networks, as well as the overall network connectivity strength.\\tMETHODS\\nwhen comparing connectivity strength at baseline to that at the end of treatment in our cohort of 10 cm(w/moh) participants, there were several connections within the salience (n = 9) and executive (n = 8) networks that were significantly improved.\\tRESULTS\\nwithin the salience network, improved connectivity was observed between the prefrontal cortex and various regions of the insula, basal ganglia, motor, and frontal cortex.\\tRESULTS\\nadditionally, changes in connectivity were observed between regions of the temporal cortex with the basal ganglia and supramarginal gyrus.\\tRESULTS\\nwithin the cen, improved connectivity was observed between the prefrontal cortex and regions of the anterior thalamus, caudate, and frontal cortex.\\tRESULTS\\nafter treatment, the overall cen connectivity was significantly improved (baseline 0.00 +/- 0.08; 6 weeks 0.03 +/- 0.09, p = .01); however, the overall salience network connectivity was not significantly improved (baseline -0.01 +/- 0.10; 6 weeks 0.01 +/- 0.12, p = .26).\\tRESULTS\\nadditionally, after treatment, there was a significant reduction in the number of moderate/severe headache days per month (baseline 21.1 +/- 6.6; 6 weeks 11.2 +/- 6.5, p < .001), hit-6 (baseline 66.1 +/- 2.6; 6 weeks 60.2 +/- 3.6, p < .001), and phq-9 (baseline 12.4 +/- 5.7; 6 weeks 6.1 +/- 3.6, p = .008) scores.\\tRESULTS\\nin this longitudinal fmri study, we observed improved functional connectivity within both networks, primarily involving connectivity between regions of the prefrontal cortex and limbic (cortical-limbic) structures, and between different cortical (cortical-cortical) regions after a series of repetitive spg blockades.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe overall cen strength was also improved.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nour results suggest that recurrent parasympathetic inhibition via spg is associated with improved functional connectivity in brain regions critical to pain processing in cm(w/moh) .\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthere is a need for valid approaches to measure sexual interactions to assess the impact of behavioural interventions and to predict the impact of behaviour changes.\\tBACKGROUND\\ndifferent methods of asking about sexual behaviour often yield conflicting answers and men often report higher levels of heterosexual activity than women.\\tBACKGROUND\\nto better understand self-reported sexual behaviour data and how best to collect it, we analyzed data collected as part of a larger project (st impacts) on the social and behavioural impact of introducing community-level hiv self-testing (hivst) with counseling (semi-supervised with pre- and generic post-test counseling provided on delivery or collection of test kits) in an urban malawian setting.\\tOBJECTIVE\\ninformation on sexual behaviour was collected from hiv self-testers over a three-month period.\\tMETHODS\\nthree different methods were used: retrospective face-to-face interviews (ftfi); audio computer assisted self-interviews (acasi) and a prospective coital diary.\\tMETHODS\\nboth retrospective instruments were used before and after the three-month study period.\\tMETHODS\\nfrequency and cross-tabulation, as well as scatterplots, were used for exploratory analyses.\\tMETHODS\\nchi-square tests were used to test for differences in proportions.\\tMETHODS\\nspearman\\'s correlation coefficient was used to explore associations between both continuous and ordinal variables and wilcoxon\\'s paired sample and mann-whitney test was used to test for differences in such variables or between variables.\\tMETHODS\\nthere was reasonable agreement between the two retrospective methods although both yielded inconsistent answers e.g. with lower reported numbers of life-time sexual partners at the end than at the beginning of the study period.\\tRESULTS\\nthe diary method elicited higher reported levels of sex with multiple partners than both retrospective instruments which may be due to inadequate recall.\\tRESULTS\\nover the study period 37.4% of men and 19.7% of women reported multiple sexual partners using the diary.\\tRESULTS\\nthere was no clear relationship between reported sexual behaviour and hiv status (prevalence 9.6%).\\tRESULTS\\ndiaries may therefore have higher validity for sensitive behaviour reporting and thus be the preferred method in similar african contexts in measuring sexual behaviours.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ncommunity ecology involves studying the interdependence of species with each other and their environment to predict their geographical distribution and abundance.\\tBACKGROUND\\nmodern species distribution analyses characterise species-environment dependency well, but offer only crude approximations of species interdependency.\\tBACKGROUND\\ntypically, the dependency between focal species and other species is characterised using other species\\' point occurrences as spatial covariates to constrain the focal species\\' predicted range.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis implicitly assumes that the strength of interdependency is homogeneous across space, which is not generally supported by analyses of species interactions.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis discrepancy has an important bearing on the accuracy of inferences about habitat suitability for species.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe introduce a framework that integrates principles from consumer-resource analyses, resource selection theory and species distribution modelling to enhance quantitative prediction of species geographical distributions.\\tMETHODS\\nwe show how to apply the framework using a case study of lynx and snowshoe hare interactions with each other and their environment.\\tMETHODS\\nthe analysis shows how the framework offers a spatially refined understanding of species distribution that is sensitive to nuances in biophysical attributes of the environment that determine the location and strength of species interactions.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nconventional thermal processes have been very reliable in offering safe sterilized meat products, but some of those products are of questionable overall

patients who died with those who survived to identify risk factors for mortality.\\tMETHODS\\nthe most frequent hnc localization was the oropharynx (43%), and pneumonia was the most frequent source (25%).\\tRESULTS\\ngram-positive bsi occurred in 55% cases, mainly due to streptococcus pneumoniae (21%), and among gram-negatives, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were the most frequent.\\tRESULTS\\nhypoalbuminemia (or 8.4; 95% ci, 3.5-19.9), previous chemotherapy (or, 3.2; 95% ci, 1.3-7.4) and cetuximab therapy (or, 2.8; 95% ci, 1.6-6.7) were significant risk factors for bsi.\\tRESULTS\\npatients with bsi had a higher overall case-fatality rate than patients without bsi (or, 4.4; 95% ci, 1.7-11.8).\\tRESULTS\\nhypoalbuminemia was an independent risk factor for the early (7 day) and overall (30 day) case-fatalities, with ors of 0.8 (95% ci, 0.6-0.9) and 0.8 (95% ci, 0.7-0.97), respectively.\\tRESULTS\\nthe presence of comorbidities (or, 7; 95% ci,

a common phenomenon but is undermanaged and underassessed in hospitalised neonates.\\tBACKGROUND\\ninformation for clinician selecting pain measurements to improve neonatal care and outcomes is still limited.\\tBACKGROUND\\na prospective observational study was used.\\tMETHODS\\na total of 1,080 pain assessments were made at 90 neonates by two nurses independently, using three scales viewing three phases of videotaped painful (arterial blood sampling) and nonpainful procedures (diaper change).\\tMETHODS\\ninternal consistency, inter-rater reliability, discriminant validity, concurrent validity and convergent validity of scales were analysed.\\tMETHODS\\nfeasibility, clinical utility and nurses\\' preference of scales were also investigated.\\tMETHODS\\nall three scales showed excellent inter-rater coefficients (from 0.991-0.992) and good internal consistency (0.733 for the premature infant pain profile-revised, 0.837 for the neonatal pain, agitation, and sedation scale and 0.836 for the neonatal infant acute pain assessment scale, respectively).\\tRESULTS\\nscores of painful and nonpainful procedures on the three scales changed significantly across the phases.\\tRESULTS\\nthere was a strong correlation between the three scales with adequate limits of agreement.\\tRESULTS\\nthe mean scores of the neonatal pain, agitation, and sedation scale for feasibility and utility were significantly higher than those of the neonatal infant acute pain assessment scale, but not significantly higher than those of the premature infant pain profile-revised.\\tRESULTS\\nthe neonatal pain, agitation, and sedation scale was mostly preferred by 55.9% of the nurses, followed by the neonatal infant acute pain assessment scale (23.5%) and the premature infant pain profile-revised (20.6%).\\tRESULTS\\nthe three scales are all reliable and valid, but the neonatal pain, agitation, and sedation scale and the neonatal infant acute pain assessment scale perform better in reliability.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe neonatal pain, agitation, and sedation scale appears to be a better choice for frontier nurses to assess procedural pain in ventilated neonates based on its good feasibility, utility and nurses\\' preference.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nchoosing a valid, reliable, feasible and practical measurement is the key step for better management of procedural pain for ventilated newborns.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nusing the right and suitable tool is helpful to accurately identify pain, ultimately improve the neonatal care and outcomes.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe aim of this systematic review

an important factor enabling them to maintain abstinence in everyday life.\\tBACKGROUND\\nalso of relevance for abstinence, and in particular craving for alcohol, is the severity of the dependence.\\tBACKGROUND\\nnumerous studies have focused on the duration of abstinence, but not on the severity of the disease.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis study investigates if, in addition to abstinence duration, also the severity of the alcohol addiction influences stress responsiveness and ability to cope with stress.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nanother objective is to ascertain in which patients such an influence can be found.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe results can shed light on the complex bidirectional relationship between alcoholism and stress, but are also potentially useful in treating patients with this disease.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nin a cross-sectional design, 64 alcohol-dependent patients and 30 healthy controls were examined.\\tMETHODS\\nthe alcoholics sample was divided in two groups according to a duration of abstinence of seven days and, 70 days.\\tMETHODS\\neach group was further divided in a subgroup of individuals with mild to moderate alcohol addiction and in a subgroup of patients with severe alcohol addiction (a7-severe and a70-severe).\\tMETHODS\\nusing the trierer social stress test (tsst), all participants were subjected to acute stress.\\tMETHODS\\nparameters measured were salivary cortisol, skin conductance -response, heart rate, addiction-related variables (addiction severity, duration of alcohol abuse, drinking quantity, craving, liver enzymes, family history of alcoholism, number of therapies, smoking), psychopathological variables (anxiety, depression, live events, personality disorders), acute and long-term stress coping, and level of strain on everyday life.\\tMETHODS\\nin patients with severe addiction, the reaction to stress is weaker and slightly retarded, but also of a longer duration than that patients with mild and moderate addiction and of healthy controls.\\tRESULTS\\nthis is independent of the length of abstinence (7 days and 70 days).\\tRESULTS\\nin severely ill patients, strategies for coping with acute stress differed from those of the other groups in that they consisted in stronger flight and avoidance responses, a stronger need for social support, and a more intense mental preoccupation.\\tRESULTS\\nincreased levels of social tension, lack of social recognition, and isolation indicated chronic stress.\\tRESULTS\\npatients with severe alcohol addiction also showed a more pronounced familial predisposition, stronger craving, increased anxiety, a longer history of alcohol abuse, and a higher frequency of incisive life events than patients with mild to moderate alcohol addiction.\\tRESULTS\\nthe results indicate that a more differentiated evaluation of stress responsiveness and stress coping in persons with an alcohol addiction not only length of abstinence, but also severity of disease have to be taken into account.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nfurther research is necessary to adjust treatment accordingly.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nin gamma-aminobutyric acid type a (gaba(a)) receptors, the structural elements that couple ligand binding to channel opening remain poorly defined.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhere, site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine if loop 9 on the non-gaba binding site interface of the beta2-subunit may be involved in gaba(a) receptor activation.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nspecifically, residues gly(170)-gln(185) of the beta2-subunit were mutated to alanine, co-expressed with wild-type alpha1- and gamma2s-subunits in human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells and assayed for their activation by gaba, the intravenous anesthetic propofol and the endogenous neurosteroid pregnanolone using whole cell macroscopic recordings.\\tMETHODS\\nthree mutants, g170a, v175a, and g177a, produced 2.5-, 6.7-, and 5.6-fold increases in gaba ec(50) whereas one mutant, q185a, produced a 5.2-fold decrease in gaba ec(50).\\tRESULTS\\nnone of the mutations affected the ability of propofol or pregnanolone to potentiate a submaximal gaba response, but the q185a mutant exhibited 8.3- and 3.5-fold increases in the percent direct activation by propofol and pregnanolone, respectively.\\tRESULTS\\nmutant q185a receptors also had an increased leak current that was sensitive to picrotoxin, indicating an increased gating efficiency.\\tRESULTS\\nfurther q185e, q185l, and q185w substitutions revealed a strong correlation between the hydropathy of the amino acid at this position and the gaba ec(50).\\tRESULTS\\ntaken together, these results indicate that beta2 loop 9 is involved in receptor activation by gaba, propofol, and pregnanolone and that beta2(q185) participates in hydrophilic interactions that are important for stabilizing the closed state of the gaba(a) receptor.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nlowering the likelihood of hospitalization in older adults is a major public health goal for

chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, revealing two distinct proteomic profiles at two phases of virus replication.\\tMETHODS\\nrelative to mock-infected cells, 168 signature proteins exhibited abundance changes at the first sign of gag p24 production (8 h postinfection [p.i.]) or the peak of virus replication (24 h p.i.); interestingly, most of the changes were exclusive to only one phase of virus replication.\\tRESULTS\\nbased on characterization by functional ontology and known human-hiv protein interactions, we observed the enrichment for protein abundance increases pertaining to protein synthesis and nucleasomal reorganization amid an otherwise placid cellular proteome at the first sign of hiv replication.\\tRESULTS\\nin contrast, we observed indications of decreased protein turnover, concomitant with heightened dna repair activities and preludes to apoptosis, in the presence of robust virus replication.\\tRESULTS\\nwe also observed hints of disruptions in protein and small molecule trafficking.\\tRESULTS\\nour label-free proteomic strategy allowed us to perform multiplexed comparisons-we buttressed our detection specificity with the use of a reverse transcriptase inhibitor as a counterscreen, enabling highlighting of cellular protein abundance changes unique to robust virus replication as opposed to viral entry.\\tRESULTS\\nin conjunction with complementary high-throughput screens for cellular partners of hiv, we put forth a model pinpointing specific rerouting of cellular biosynthetic, energetic, and trafficking pathways as hiv replication accelerates in human primary cd4 cells.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nserine/threonine phosphatase regulation of phosphorylation-mediated intracellular signaling controls a number of important processes in mammalian cells.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin this study, we show that constitutively active protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a), which is a serine/threonine phosphatase, is essential for t leukemia cell survival.\\tOBJECTIVE\\njurkat and ccrf-cem t leukemia cells treated with the pp2a-selective inhibitor okadaic acid (oa) showed a dose- and time-dependent induction of apoptosis, as indicated by loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi(m)), cleavage-induced activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and dna fragmentation.\\tRESULTS\\nin addition, caspase-8 or caspase-9 inhibition with z-ietd-fmk or z-lehd-fmk, respectively, largely prevented oa-induced apoptosis.\\tRESULTS\\nalthough oa treatment did not affect constitutive bcl-2 expression, overexpression of bcl-2 prevented both oa-induced dna fragmentation and dissipation of delta psi(m).\\tRESULTS\\nfurthermore, inhibition of caspase-3, -8, or -9 partially protected against oa-induced loss of delta psi(m).\\tRESULTS\\nin addition, caspase-9 and caspase-3 inhibition largely prevented procaspase-3 and procaspase-8 cleavage, respectively, while caspase-8 inhibition partially interfered with procaspase-9 cleavage in oa-treated t leukemia cells.\\tRESULTS\\nthus, pp2a inhibition triggered the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, which was enhanced by a mitochondrial feedback amplification loop.\\tRESULTS\\npp2a has also been implicated in the regulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk).\\tRESULTS\\nco-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed a physical association between the catalytic subunit of pp2a and p38 mapk in t leukemia cells.\\tRESULTS\\nmoreover, oa treatment caused p38 mapk to be phosphorylated in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, indicating that pp2a prevented p38 mapk activation.\\tRESULTS\\nalthough p38 mapk activation usually promotes apoptosis, pharmacologic inhibition of p38 mapk exacerbated oa-induced dna fragmentation and loss of delta psi(m) in t leukemia cells, suggesting that, in this instance, the p38 mapk signaling pathway promoted cell survival.\\tRESULTS\\ncollectively, these findings indicate that pp2a and p38 mapk have coordinate effects on signaling pathways that regulate the survival of t leukemia cells.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\npressure ulcers (pus) in individuals with spinal cord injury (sci) present a persistent and costly problem.\\tBACKGROUND\\ncontinuing effort in developing new technologies that support self-managed care is an important prevention strategy.\\tBACKGROUND\\nspecifically, the aims of this scoping

prevention practices.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthere is broad consensus that sustaining long-term adherence to prevention regimens is a major concern.\\tRESULTS\\nrecent literature highlights the interactions between behavioral and physiological risk factors.\\tRESULTS\\nwe identify four technology categories that support self-management: computer-based educational technologies demonstrated improved short-term gains in knowledge (2 studies), interface pressure mapping technologies demonstrated improved adherence to pressure-relief schedules up to 3 mo (5 studies), electrical stimulation confirmed improvements in tissue tolerance after 8 wk of training (3 studies), and telemedicine programs demonstrated improvements in independence and reduced hospital visits over 6 mo (2 studies).\\tRESULTS\\noverall, self-management technologies demonstrated low-to-moderate effectiveness in addressing a subset of risk factors.\\tRESULTS\\nhowever, the effectiveness of technologies in preventing pus is limited due to a lack of incidence reporting.\\tRESULTS\\nin light of the key findings, we recommend developing integrated technologies that address multiple risk

surgeries and procedures.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\npolycomb complexes function as enforcers of epigenetically repressed state, balanced by an antagonist state mediated by trithorax.\\tBACKGROUND\\nusing sensitive methods of sequence analysis, we show here that polycomb-like proteins (pcls) contain a tandem of intimately associated domains, which we named pwapa and which is also present in ash2l, a member of the trithorax group.\\tOBJECTIVE\\npolycomb-like proteins and ash2l belong to the pcr2 and mll histone methyltransferase complexes, respectively.\\tRESULTS\\na pwapa cassette is also present in atac2, a component of the atac histone acetyltransferase complex.\\tRESULTS\\nthe recently solved structure of the pwapa tandem of ash2l has revealed that it consist in a phd-like finger followed by a helix-winged-helix (wh) domain, able to bind dna.\\tRESULTS\\nthe modeling of the 3d structure of the different members of the pwapa family suggests that the phd-like finger might be able, at least for some proteins of the family, to bind methylated marks on histones.\\tRESULTS\\nthe pwapa phd/wh cassette might thus be involved in the combined recognition of dna and specific (perhaps methylation) mark(s) on histones, thereby allowing the recruitment of specific chromatin-modifying activities at these sites.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe observations reported here should help to unravel the exact role played by the pwapa cassette in the different proteins of the pwapa family, and especially in the antagonistic activities of pcg and trxg proteins.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of unroofed coronary sinus (cs) syndrome at a tertiary hospital and analyze the clinical information, cardiovascular ct angiography (ccta) imaging findings, associated anomalies, and surgical treatment of the identified cases.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nwe retrospectively searched the database of a tertiary hospital for cases of unroofed cs syndrome among patients who underwent ccta for known or suspected congenital heart disease.\\tMETHODS\\nafter the prevalence of unroofed cs syndrome was determined, ccta findings, associated cardiovascular abnormalities, presence or absence of airway compression, clinical information, and surgical outcome were recorded.\\tMETHODS\\na total of 23 patients with unroofed cs syndrome were identified, with the syndrome therefore having a prevalence of 0.36% among patients with congenital heart disease who underwent ccta.\\tRESULTS\\nthe diagnostic accuracy of ccta for unroofed cs syndrome was 100%, whereas that of echocardiography was 69%.\\tRESULTS\\ntype i unroofed cs syndrome was the most commonly noted type (52% of patients).\\tRESULTS\\nall 23 patients had associated cardiovascular anomalies, including persistent left superior vena cava (65% of patients) and atrial septal defect (65%).\\tRESULTS\\nsurgery was performed for 70% of patients because of cardiovascular anomalies.\\tRESULTS\\nseven patients (30%) had associated secondary airway compression but did not require surgical correction.\\tRESULTS\\nat our institution, the prevalence of unroofed cs syndrome was 0.36% among patients with congenital heart disease who underwent ccta.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nccta has excellent diagnostic performance, delineating different subtypes of unroofed cs syndrome and associated cardiovascular planning for treatment of unroofed cs syndrome abnormalities, improving clinical decision making, and permitting preoperative planning for treatment of unroofed cs syndrome.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\norganization of the stromal compartments in secondary lymphoid tissue is a prerequisite for an efficient immune reaction.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin particular, follicular dendritic cells (fdc) are pivotal for the activation and differentiation of b cells.\\tBACKGROUND\\nto investigate the development of fdc, fdc together with tightly associated b cells (fdc networks) were micro-dissected from frozen tissue sections and follicular b cells were sorted by facs.\\tMETHODS\\nusing an in silico subtraction approach, gene expression of fdc was determined and compared with that of follicular stromal cells micro-dissected from the spleen of scid mice.\\tMETHODS\\nnearly 90% of the fdc genes were expressed in follicular stromal cells of the scid mouse, providing further evidence that fdc develop from the residual network of reticular cells.\\tRESULTS\\nthus, it suggests that rather minor modifications in the gene expression profile are sufficient for differentiation into mature fdc.\\tRESULTS\\nthe analysis of different immune-deficient mouse strains shows that a complex pattern of gene regulation controls the development of residual stromal cells into mature fdc.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe in silico subtraction approach provides a molecular framework within which to determine the diverse roles of fdc in support of b cells and to investigate the differentiation of fdc from their mesenchymal precursor cells.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nclonorchis sinensis causes the important food-borne zoonosis, clonorchiasis, which is endemic in east asia, especially in china mainly in guangdong, guangxi and heilongjiang provinces and korea.\\tBACKGROUND\\nalthough comparisons on isoenzymes and some molecular profiles of c. sinensis collected from different parts of china and korea have been studied, few works on the genetic variation among the individuals from different regions of china has been reported.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin the present study, individual adults of c. sinensis were collected from cats in two geographic locations (guangdong province in the south and heilongjiang province in the north) of china and 44 of them were examined by using random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr and mobile genetic elements (mges)-pcr techniques to assess the individual genetic variability within and between the two groups of this parasite.\\tMETHODS\\nsix arbitrary primers and two pairs of mge primers were employed in the genomic dna amplification.\\tMETHODS\\nthe molecular patterns showed significant polymorphism among the individuals.\\tRESULTS\\nthe rapd data displayed that the similarity coefficient (sc) of the individuals within heilongjiang group was much higher than that of the guangdong group, which was further confirmed by mge-pcr results.\\tRESULTS\\nindividuals from heilongjiang were found genetically closer with lesser polymorphisms than those collected from guangdong province.\\tRESULTS\\nthese results demonstrated that rapd and mge-pcr techniques, particularly rapd method, could be useful for investigating genetic variations among c. sinensis individuals.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthey may also indicate that the genetic variation of c. sinensis occurs in the subtropical region--guangdong--faster than that in the cold-region--heilongjiang province--due to more generations (life cycle) occurred.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nbody image dissatisfaction has been linked to

evaluation.\\tMETHODS\\nthe estimation of the action of colitis on tgi and constipation as well as the protective effect of extract, the intestinal biochemical and physiological parameters were measured using the charcoal meal test, loperamide (lop)-induced constipation as well as spectrophotometric assays.\\tMETHODS\\nfcae (150 and 300mgkg(-1)) was administered orally once per day for seven days 1h after the loperamide treatment.\\tMETHODS\\nphenol-red colorimetric method was used to explore the action of fcae on gastric emptying process.\\tMETHODS\\nulcerative colitis caused a significantly gastrointestinal motility inhibition in normal rats and notably aggravated the constipation in lop group.\\tRESULTS\\noppositely, fcae oral intake significantly increased levels of the gastrointestinal transit ratio and gastric emptying by accelerating of their times.\\tRESULTS\\nmoreover, constipation severity induced by colitis was remarkably reduced in the fcae treatment group, as demonstrated by a marked management of fecal parameters, water content, oxidative stress indicators, lipid metabolism, and intracellular mediators.\\tRESULTS\\nphytochemical analysis of fcae revealed the presence of carbohydrates, polysaccharides, phenolic acids as gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, syringic acid and ellagic acid, and flavonoids (e.g. rutin, catechin, epicatechin and apeginine).\\tRESULTS\\nthe obtained results indicated that fcae exhibits a natural laxative effect without provoking diarrhea and ameliorates functional gastrointestinal (gi) and motility disorders thus justifying its traditional usage.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nfragile, dilated moyamoya vessels are the main source of hemorrhagic stroke in moyamoya disease (mmd).\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever, the prevalence of hemorrhagic stroke largely differs between asian and western countries, although the underlying pathophysiology has not been clarified.\\tBACKGROUND\\nto systematically analyze the difference of collateral angioarchitectures between japanese and european caucasians with mmd.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthis study included 71 patients with mmd, including japanese (n = 41) and european caucasians (n =

density may be associated with lower prevalence of hiv and other sexually transmitted infections (stis).\\tBACKGROUND\\non-premise sale of alcohol for immediate consumption is theorized as increasing social interactions that can lead to sexual encounters.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe examined associations between on- and off-premise retail alcohol sales licenses and number of newly diagnosed hiv and sti cases in texas counties.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nretail alcohol sales license data were obtained from the texas alcoholic beverage commission.\\tMETHODS\\nhiv and bacterial sti data were obtained from the texas

(e.g., bar and restaurant) alcohol license per 10,000 population in a county was associated with a 1.5% increase (95% ci: 0.4%, 2.6%) in the rate of hiv and a 2.4% increase (95% ci: 1.9%, 3.0%) in the rate of bacterial stis, adjusting for potential confounders.\\tRESULTS\\nin contrast, number of off-premise licenses (e.g., take-out stores) was inversely associated with the incidence of sti and hiv, although the association with hiv was not statistically significant.\\tRESULTS\\nthis study adds to the limited literature on the association between retail alcohol availability and

(aki) is common in neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu).\\tBACKGROUND\\naki is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and a greater long-term risk of chronic kidney disease.\\tBACKGROUND\\nto study the incidence and outcome of neonatal aki in a single saudi arabian center, level 2\\\\3 nicu.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthis single-center prospective cohort study included all infants who received level ii or iii nicu care during 2015 (january to december).\\tMETHODS\\nwe excluded infants who survived less than 48 h after admission, had evidence of congenital renal anomalies, or had insufficient data.\\tMETHODS\\naki was defined according to the kidney disease: improving global outcomes (kdigo) criteria.\\tMETHODS\\nboth aki and non-aki neonates were prospectively followed up until nicu discharge.\\tMETHODS\\noutcomes studied included mortality and length of nicu stay.\\tMETHODS\\nthe results of adjusted risk analyses were expressed as relative risk (rr) with 95% confidence interval (95% ci).\\tMETHODS\\nthe incidence of aki (modified neonatal kdigo stages) was 56% (120/214 patients).\\tRESULTS\\ncompared with neonates without aki, those with aki had a lower birth weight (2202 +/- 816 vs. 1570 +/- 776 g; p < 0.001) and a lower gestational age (35 +/- 3 vs. 32 +/- 4 weeks; p < 0.001).\\tRESULTS\\nafter adjustment for potential confounders, only gestational age (rr, 4.8; 95% ci, 3-9) and perinatal depression (rr, 10; 95% ci, 2-46) were significantly associated with an increased risk of aki.\\tRESULTS\\nfor infants with gestational age < 32 weeks, only the clinical risk index for babies (crib ii) score was associated with an increased risk of aki (rr, 1.9; 95% ci, 1-3).\\tRESULTS\\nafter adjustment for gestational age, aki was significantly associated with mortality (rr, 5.4; 95% ci, 2-14), but not with the length of hospital stay (los) (p = 0.133).\\tRESULTS\\nhowever, the aki group had a significantly longer los (mean difference: 14 days; 95% ci, 5.5-23 days), and 33 patients (27.5%) with aki were discharged with abnormally high serum creatinine levels (> 65 mumol/l).\\tRESULTS\\naki occurred in more than half of all nicu admissions, was associated with an increased risk of mortality, and had a higher incidence among smaller and sicker infants.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ntherefore, close monitoring of renal function during hospitalization and after discharge is warranted in such infants.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\na 2000 mm long saturated laboratory soil column was used to simulate soil aquifer treatment under saturated conditions to assess the removal of chemical and biochemical oxygen demand (cod and bod), dissolved organic carbon (doc), nitrogen and phosphate, using high strength artificial wastewater.\\tMETHODS\\nthe removal rates were determined under a combination of constant hydraulic loading rates (hlr) and variable cod concentrations as well as variable hlr under a constant cod.\\tMETHODS\\nwithin the range of cod concentrations considered (42 mg l-1-135 mg l-1) it was found that at fixed hydraulic loading rate, a decrease in the influent concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (doc), biochemical oxygen demand (bod), total nitrogen and phosphate improved their removal efficiencies.\\tRESULTS\\nat the high cod concentrations applied residence times influenced the redox conditions in the soil column.\\tRESULTS\\nlong residence times were detrimental to the removal process for cod, bod and doc as anoxic processes and sulphate reduction played an important role as electron acceptors.\\tRESULTS\\nit was found that total cod mass loading within the range of 911 mg d-1-1780 mg d-1 applied as low cod wastewater infiltrated coupled with short residence times would provide better effluent quality than the same mass applied as a cod with higher concentration at long residence times.\\tRESULTS\\nthe opposite was true for organic nitrogen where relatively high concentrations coupled with long residence time gave better removal efficiency.\\tRESULTS\\nglucose biosensors are key components of closed-loop glycaemic control (insulin delivery) systems for

confidence interval includes no difference (md 38.80, 95% ci -11.19 to 88.79).\\tRESULTS\\ngrading of outcomes ranged from moderate to very low quality, with quality of outcomes downgraded for

proteins in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe orally administrated eps exhibited an excellent hypoglycemic effect, lowering the average plasma glucose level, and increasing insulin secretion in diabetic rats.\\tRESULTS\\nthe 2-de analysis of rat plasma demonstrated that about 500 visualized spots were differentially regulated, of which 20 spots were identified as principal diabetes-associated proteins.\\tRESULTS\\nthe distinct effect of diabetes induction on the pattern of rat plasma proteins includes the down-regulation of albumin, apolipoprotein e (apo e), alpha1-inhibitor-3, fetuin beta, gc-globulin, hemopexin, vitronectin, and transthyretin (ttr) monomer, and the up-regulation of apo a-i, apo a-iv, ceruloplasmin, alpha1-antitrypsin, serine protease inhibitor iii, and transferrin.\\tRESULTS\\nthose protein levels were interestingly restored to those of healthy rats by eps treatment, although the order of magnitude of the changes differed widely.\\tRESULTS\\ntwo proteins of interest showed distinct differential expression with opposite trends: ttr tetramer was significantly down-regulated and immunoglobulin (ig) kappa light chain was significantly up-regulated upon diabetes induction, both of which were also normalized to those of healthy groups after eps treatment.\\tRESULTS\\ntrimethylamine n-oxide (tmao) is a small organic

(ncds).\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever, questions remain about how to enhance the hiv platforms to deliver integrated hiv and ncd care to people living with hiv (plhiv) in sub-saharan africa (ssa).\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe aimed to develop a priority research agenda to advance this effort.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nresearchers, policymakers, and implementers from the united states and ssa conducted three scoping reviews on hiv/ncd prevention and care focused on clinical, health system, and community levels.\\tMETHODS\\nbased on the review findings and expert inputs, we conducted iterative

quality of life (qol) of this group of parents.\\tBACKGROUND\\ntherefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of parental qol among parents seeking treatment for their child\\'s abdominal pain.\\tOBJECTIVE\\n133 parents of 7-13-year-old children diagnosed with fap reported on their health-related qol (hrqol), as assessed by the sf-12, and on caregiver-related qol, as assessed by two chq-pf50 scales (emotional impact, time impact).\\tMETHODS\\nt tests were used to compare the parents\\' scores on these measures with reference scores.\\tMETHODS\\nsubgroups which were at risk of impairment were defined by cut-off scores.\\tMETHODS\\ndeterminants of parental qol were identified by hierarchical regression analyses.\\tMETHODS\\nwhile the parents showed significantly poorer mental health compared to population-based reference samples (d = 0.33-0.58), their physical health did not differ.\\tRESULTS\\nhowever, parents were severely strained with respect to the time impact and emotional impact of their child\\'s health (d = 0.33-1.58).\\tRESULTS\\nwhile 12.7-27.9% of the parents were at risk of poor hrqol, 60.6-70.1% were highly strained due to the demands of their role as caregivers.\\tRESULTS\\nphysical and mental health were best explained by parents\\' psychiatric symptoms, while parents\\' perception of their child\\'s impairment additionally determined the high time and emotional impact.\\tRESULTS\\nphysical hrqol is not impaired in the majority of parents seeking treatment for their child\\'s functional abdominal pain.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nhowever, the time demands and worries due to the child\\'s pain deserve specific attention.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\npsychosocial interventions for a child\\'s fap should include information provided to the parents about coping with time constraints and emotional impact.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nfurther prospective studies are warranted.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe biomimetic reproduction of adhesion organs, as found in flies, beetles and geckoes, has become a topic of intense research over the past years.\\tBACKGROUND\\nsuccesses, however, have so far been limited.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis is

children who continue breastfeeding beyond early infancy.\\tBACKGROUND\\ntherefore, we examined available information on breastmilk zinc concentration and total milk consumption to develop estimates of the amount of zinc transferred in breastmilk to children of different ages.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nbreastmilk zinc concentration declines rapidly during the first few months postpartum and more slowly thereafter.\\tRESULTS\\nbreastmilk supplies all of the theoretical zinc needs for at least the first several months of life, although the period during which breastmilk alone remains sufficient is uncertain.\\tRESULTS\\nbreastmilk continues to provide more than half of children\\'s estimated zinc requirements after the introduction of complementary foods, even into the second year of life.\\tRESULTS\\npublic health programs to promote and support breastfeeding should be included among the strategies to ensure adequate zinc status of young children.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\npresentation of

anterior uveal tract involvement and neovascular glaucoma.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nas edi-oct showed involvement and increased thickening of choroid in both cases of bdump and iues, it may be better to consider such cases as leopard chorioretinopathy and categorize these entities as a member of pachychoroid pigment retinopathy disorders.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe reliability of using between-visit variation in fev1 to diagnose asthma is understudied, and hence uncertain.\\tBACKGROUND\\nto determine if fev1 variability measured over recurrent visits is significantly associated with a diagnosis of current asthma.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nrandomly-selected adults (n=964) with a history of physician-diagnosed asthma were studied from 2005-2007 and from 2012-2016.\\tMETHODS\\na diagnosis of current asthma was confirmed in those participants who exhibited bronchial hyper-responsiveness to methacholine and/or acute worsening of asthma symptoms while being weaned off asthma medications.\\tMETHODS\\nregression analyses and receiver operating curves were used to evaluate the ability of between-visit fev1 variability to diagnose asthma.\\tMETHODS\\na current diagnosis of asthma was confirmed in 584 of 964 participants (60%).\\tRESULTS\\nbetween-visit absolute variability in fev1 was significantly greater in those in whom current asthma was confirmed, compared to those in whom current asthma was ruled out (7.3% vs 4.8%, mean difference between the 2 groups = 2.5%; 95% ci: 1.7-3.3%).\\tRESULTS\\nhowever, a 12 percent and 200 ml between-visit variation in fev1, which is the diagnostic threshold recommended by gina, exhibited a sensitivity of only 0.17 and a specificity of 0.94 for confirming current asthma.\\tRESULTS\\na between-visit absolute variability in fev1 >/= 12% and 200 ml increased the pre-test probability of asthma from 60% to a post-test probability of 81%.\\tRESULTS\\na 12% and 200 ml between-visit variation in fev1, if present, has reasonably good specificity for diagnosing asthma, but has poor sensitivity compared to bronchial challenge testing.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nbetween-visit variability in fev1 is a relatively unhelpful test to establish a diagnosis of asthma.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ncystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder due to intestinal and renal transport defects in cystine and dibasic amino acids, which result in recurrent

injuries were significantly higher compared with the rates of injuries sustained among players without forearm injuries in both leagues ( p < .001).\\tRESULTS\\nfinally, 26 (19.4%) mlb and 56 (8.9%) minor league players required an ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction, rates that were significantly higher compared with players without a flexor strain ( p < .001).\\tRESULTS\\nflexor-pronator injuries are responsible for considerable time spent on the dl for elite players in mlb and the minor leagues.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe most significant findings of this investigation illustrate that a

the presence and expression of morphologically distinct vascular smooth muscle cells.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin particular, in complex human vascular lesions and models of disease in pigs and rodents, an intimal smooth muscle cell (ismc) which exhibits a stable epithelioid or rhomboid phenotype in culture is often found to be present in high numbers, and may represent the reemergence of a distinct developmental vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe cyp450-oxylipin - soluble epoxide hydrolase (seh) pathway is currently of great interest in targeting for cardiovascular

cyp450-oxylipin-seh pathway enzymes and their metabolites in paired intimal (ismc) and medial (msmc) cells isolated from rat aorta.\\tMETHODS\\nismc basally released significantly larger amounts of epoxy-oxylipin cyp450 products from eicosapentaenoic acid > docosahexaenoic acid > arachidonic acid > linoleic acid, and expressed higher levels of cyp2c12, cyp2b1, but not cyp2j mrna compared to msmc.\\tRESULTS\\nwhen stimulated with the pro-inflammatory tlr4 ligand lps, epoxy-oxylipin production did not change greatly in ismc.\\tRESULTS\\nin contrast, lps induced epoxy-oxylipin products in msmc and induced cyp2j4.\\tRESULTS\\nismc and msmc express seh which metabolizes primary epoxy-oxylipins to their dihydroxy-counterparts.\\tRESULTS\\nthe seh inhibitors tppu or auda inhibited lps-induced nfkappab activation and inos induction in msmc, but had no effect on nfkappab nuclear localization or inducible nitric oxide synthase in ismc; effects which were recapitulated in part by addition of authentic epoxy-oxylipins.\\tRESULTS\\nismcs are a rich source but not a sensor of anti-inflammatory epoxy-oxylipins.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ncomplex lesions that contain high levels of ismcs may be more resistant to the protective effects of seh inhibitors.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nmultiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy affecting bone marrow derived plasma cells.\\tBACKGROUND\\ncurrent therapies

cytoreductive surgery on survival parameters in women with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer who undergone secondary cytoreduction following chemotherapy compared to women who recieved chemotherapy alone.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nin a retrospective study, data were rewieved from women who were diagnosed and treated with ovarian cancer and its primary platinum-sensitive recurrence at the university hospital brno in the czech republic between november 2009 and march 2016.\\tMETHODS\\nout of the total number of 62 patients with recurrence, 30 women underwent cytoreductive surgery plus chemotherapy and 32 were treated with chemotherapy alone.\\tMETHODS\\nthe good performance status expressed by ecog score 0-1, the single site of recurrence regardless of platinum-free interval or multiple sites of recurrence but no carcinomatosis and platinum-free interval >12 months, and no or small-volume ascites (<500ml) were considered inclusion criteria for cytoreductive surgery.\\tMETHODS\\nwomen not meeting these criteria were treated by chemotherapy alone.\\tMETHODS\\ndescriptive statistics, kaplan-meier survival curves and log-rank test were used for statistical estimations.\\tMETHODS\\nthe analysis confirmed more favorable prognosis in patient group treated with a combination secondary cytoreduction and chemotherapy.\\tRESULTS\\nmean disease-free survival (dfs) was 49.8 months (95% ci; 33.2-66.3) and mean overall survival (os) stood at 54.0 months (95% ci; 39.4-68.6) in this patient cohort, while in patient group treated with chemotherapy alone it was found that mean dfs was 16.6 months (95% ci; 7.4-25.8) and mean os stood at 26.2 months (95% ci; 16.6-35.8).\\tRESULTS\\nwhen testing the difference between survival curves, statistically significant differences were observed in both dfs (p=0.010) and os (p=0.007) rates between two treatment groups.\\tRESULTS\\nage < 60 years at the time of recurrence and zero macroscopic residual disease after secondary cytoreduction were identified as favorable prognostic factors for both dfs and os in a multivariate analysis.\\tRESULTS\\nsecondary cytoreductive surgery is acceptable as a viable treatment option for highly selected women with ovarian cancer recurrence.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ncomplete resection is considered ultimate goal of secondary cytoreduction on condition that the balance between maximal

radiographs in patients with benign and malignant bone tumors.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nin 32 patients with a benign or malignant bone lesion (mean age 33.9 +/- 18.5 years, 17 females), 3-t mr imaging was performed including a 3d t1-weighted gradient echo sequence as the basis for the ct-like images.\\tMETHODS\\nfrom these, intensity-inverted mr image volumes were converted into 2d images via a forward projection to obtain simulated radiographs.\\tMETHODS\\ntwo radiologists assessed these images as well as conventional radiographs for the type of periosteal reaction, matrix mineralization and destruction pattern.\\tMETHODS\\nagreement between the modalities was calculated using cohen\\'s kappa.\\tMETHODS\\nthe agreement between conventional radiographs and mr-derived ct-like images in combination with simulated radiographs was substantial (periosteal reaction, kappa = 0.67; destruction pattern, kappa = 0.75), and the sensitivity of both modalities for the final diagnosis of the lesion (aggressive vs. nonaggressive) was high (mr-derived ct-like images, 86.2% vs. conventional radiographs, 90.0%).\\tRESULTS\\nadditional information on soft tissue extension (mr-derived ct-like images, 21.9% vs. conventional radiographs, 12.5%; p = 0.009) and lobulation (9.4% vs. 0%; p < 0.001) was significantly more often found on mr-derived ct-like images compared with conventional radiographs.\\tRESULTS\\nthe assessment of the destruction patterns, periosteal reaction and distinction between aggressive and nonaggressive tumors was feasible using mr-derived ct-like images and simulated radiographs and is comparable to that of conventional radiographs.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nmoreover, mr-derived ct-like images provided additional information on soft tissue extension and tumor architecture.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\n* ct-like images and simulated radiographs can be generated from 3d mri.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\n* evaluation of bone tumors is feasible with mr-derived images.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\n*

countries.\\tBACKGROUND\\namong the 15 known serotypes, four (1b, 3a, 3b and 4b) contain a group 6 epitope due to an acetyl group connected to the o-2 position of rhamnose iii on the tetrasaccharide structure of the lipopolysaccharide.\\tBACKGROUND\\no-acetyltransferase encoded by a bacteriophage, sf6, mediates the acetylation reaction.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe found that the oac gene in serotype 1b strains was very different from that in serotypes 3a, 3b and 4b strains and is herein after referred to as oac 1b which shares with oac 88%-89% identity at the dna level and 85% identity at the protein level.\\tRESULTS\\nconsidering that s. flexneri strains of serotypes 1-5 share a recent common ancestry, the divergent oac 1b is more likely to have been obtained from outside s. flexneri than to have undergone rapid divergence from the oac gene in the other serotypes (3a, 3b and 4b) within s. flexneri.\\tRESULTS\\nthe cloned oac 1b gene was found to perform the same acetylation function as oac.\\tRESULTS\\nanalysis of the genomic regions flanking oac 1b showed that it was present in a prophage on the chromosome and the organizational structure is different from that of phage sf6.\\tRESULTS\\nadditionally, phage conversion assay showed that serotype 1b cannot be generated by infecting serotype 1a strains with sf6.\\tRESULTS\\nwe conclude that oac 1b was carried by a non-sf6 phage and is uniquely present in serotype 1b.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nto analyze the renal function and outcome after delayed (>6 hours) endovascular revascularization of acute renal artery occlusion

based on the experimental observation that the sign and amplitude of the change in synaptic weight is dictated by the temporal order and temporal contiguity between pre- and postsynaptic activities.\\tBACKGROUND\\nfor more than a decade, this spike-timing-dependent plasticity (stdp) has been studied mainly in brain slices of different brain structures and cultured neurons.\\tBACKGROUND\\nalthough not yet compelling, evidences for the stdp rule in the intact brain, including primary sensory cortices, have been provided lastly.\\tBACKGROUND\\nfrom insects to mammals, the presentation of precisely timed sensory inputs drives synaptic and functional plasticity in the intact central nervous system, with similar timing requirements than the in vitro defined stdp rule.\\tRESULTS\\nthe convergent evolution of this plasticity rule in species belonging to so distant phylogenic groups points to the efficiency of stdp, as a mechanism for modifying synaptic weights, as the basis of activity-dependent development, learning and memory.\\tRESULTS\\nin spite of the ubiquity of stdp phenomena, a number of significant variations of the rule are observed in different structures, neuronal types and even synapses on the same neuron, as well as between in vitro and in vivo conditions.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nin addition, the state of the neuronal network, its ongoing activity and the activation of ascending neuromodulatory systems in different behavioral conditions have dramatic consequences on the expression of spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity, and should be further explored.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\noligodendrocyte progenitor cells (opcs) have the ability to divide or to growth arrest and differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes in the developing brain.\\tBACKGROUND\\ndue to their high number and the persistence of their proliferative capacity in the adult brain, opcs are being studied as potential targets for myelin repair and also as a potential source of brain tumors.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis study addresses the molecular mechanisms regulating the transcriptional changes occurring at the critical transition between proliferation and cell cycle exit in cultured opcs.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nusing bioinformatic analysis of existing datasets, we identified c-myc as a key transcriptional regulator of this transition and confirmed direct binding of this transcription factor to identified target genes using chromatin immunoprecipitation.\\tMETHODS\\nthe expression of c-myc was elevated in proliferating opcs, where it also bound to the promoter of genes involved in cell cycle regulation (i.e. cdc2) or chromosome organization (i.e. h2afz).\\tRESULTS\\nsilencing of c-myc was associated with decreased histone acetylation at target gene promoters and consequent decrease of gene transcripts. c-myc silencing also induced a global increase of repressive histone methylation and premature peripheral nuclear chromatin compaction while promoting the progression towards differentiation.\\tRESULTS\\nwe conclude that c-myc is an important modulator of the transition between proliferation and differentiation of opcs, although its decrease is not sufficient to induce progression into a myelinating phenotype.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe potential of boron-containing lipids with three different structures, which were intended for use in boron neutron capture therapy, was investigated.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nall three types of boron lipids contained the anionic dodecaborate cluster as the headgroup.\\tBACKGROUND\\ntheir effects on two different tumor models in mice following intravenous injection were tested; for this, liposomes with boron lipid, distearoyl phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol as helper lipids, and containing a polyethylene glycol lipid for steric protection, were administered intravenously into tumor-bearing mice (c3h mice for sccvii squamous cell carcinoma and balb/c mice for ct26/wt colon carcinoma).\\tMETHODS\\nwith the exception of one lipid (b-thf-14), the lipids were well tolerated, and no other animal was lost due to systemic toxicity.\\tRESULTS\\nthe lipid which led to death was not found to be much more toxic in cell culture than the other boron lipids.\\tRESULTS\\nall of the lipids that were well tolerated showed hemorrhage in both tumor models within a few hours after administration.\\tRESULTS\\nthe hemorrhage could be seen by in vivo magnetic resonance and histology, and was found to occur within a few hours.\\tRESULTS\\nthe degree of hemorrhage depended on the amount of boron administered and on the tumor model.\\tRESULTS\\nthe observed unwanted effect of the lipids precludes their use in boron neutron capture therapy.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\na two-day-old male neonate was inadvertently immunized with 20-times the recommended dose of bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg) vaccine (1.0 ml instead of 0.05 ml).\\tBACKGROUND\\nexamination of the neonate after one day

hypothesis using functional mri and covariance analysis in 43 healthy skilled readers.\\tMETHODS\\nour results dissociated two sets of regions that were differentially engaged across subjects who were reading the same familiar words.\\tRESULTS\\nsome subjects showed more activation in left inferior frontal and anterior occipito-temporal regions while other subjects showed more activation in right inferior parietal and left posterior occipito-temporal regions.\\tRESULTS\\nto explore the behavioural correlates of these systems, we measured the difference between reading speed for irregularly spelled words relative to pseudowords outside the scanner in fifteen of our subjects and correlated this measure with fmri activation for reading familiar words.\\tMETHODS\\nthe faster the lexical reading the greater the activation in left posterior occipito-temporal and right inferior parietal regions.\\tRESULTS\\nconversely, the slower the lexical reading the greater the activation in left anterior occipito-temporal and left ventral inferior frontal regions.\\tRESULTS\\nthus, the double dissociation in irregular and pseudoword reading behaviour predicted the double dissociation in

hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) are still challenging.\\tBACKGROUND\\ntherefore, we tried to investigate the epigenetic study of three nominated genes (apc, p14, and e-cadherin) in the pathogenesis of hcv-related hcc in egyptian.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nbetween march 2016 and march 2017, the dna methylation, and quantification using (epigenetic elisa kit) for e-cadherin, apc, and p14 genes were studied in three groups of patients: hcv related liver cirrhosis without hcc group (lc-group; n= 20), hcc on top of hcv-related cirrhosis (hcc-group; n= 20), and a third apparently healthy control group (control-group; n= 10).\\tMETHODS\\ne-cad methylation showed non-significant differences between groups.\\tRESULTS\\np14 methylation was occurred only in hcc-group (45%).\\tRESULTS\\napc methylation was the highest in hcc group (70%).\\tRESULTS\\nmethylation level was high in hcc group in comparison to both lc and control groups (p< 0.001).\\tRESULTS\\ndna methylation at a cutoff point > 2.9 ng/ml predicts hcc in lc-group with 90% sensitivity and 80% specificity and at level > 2.3 ng/ml had 95% sensitivity and 90% specificity in control-group.\\tRESULTS\\nthe pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy were 90%, 60%, 69.2, 85.7 and 75% respectively.\\tRESULTS\\naberrant dna methylation of multiple genes is associated with disease progression in hcv related cirrhosis.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nmoreover, early detection of promotor methylation of these may sever as good biomarker for early detection and therapeutic targets in high risk patients.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nhemovigilance like quality systems and audits has become an integral part of the blood transfusion service (bts) in the developed world and has contributed greatly to the development of the blood service.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever developing countries are still grappling with donor recruitment and efforts towards sufficiency and safety of the blood supply.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin these countries the bts is generally fragmented and a national hemovigilance program would be difficult to implement.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever a few developing countries have an effective and sustainable blood program that can deliver equitable, safe and sufficient blood supply to the nation.\\tBACKGROUND\\ndifferent models of hemovigilance program have been introduced with variable success.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthere are deficiencies but the data collected provided important information that can be presented to the health authorities for effective interventions.\\tRESULTS\\nhemovigilance program modeled from developed countries require expertise and resources that are not available in many developing countries.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nwhatever resources that are available should be utilized to correct deficiencies that are already apparent and obvious.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nbesides there are other tools that can be used to monitor the blood

seizures.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever, cveeg is labor-intensive and the need to initiate and interpret studies on a 24-hour basis is a major limitation.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis study aims at establishing consistency in monitoring of newborns admitted to 2 different neonatal intensive care units (nicus) managed by the same neurocritical care team.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nneonatal nurses were trained to apply scalp electrodes, troubleshoot technical issues, and identify amplitude-integrated eeg abnormalities.\\tMETHODS\\nguidelines, checklists, and visual training modules were developed.\\tMETHODS\\na central network system allowed remote access to the cveegs by the epileptologist for timely interpretation and feedback.\\tMETHODS\\na cohort of 100 infants with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy before and after the training program was compared.\\tMETHODS\\nduring the study period, 192 cveegs were obtained.\\tRESULTS\\nthe time to initiate brain monitoring decreased by 31.5 hours posttraining; this, in turn, led to an increase in electrographic seizure detection (20% before vs 34% after), decrease in seizure clinical misdiagnosis (65% before and 36% after), and reduction in antiseizure medication burden.\\tRESULTS\\ntraining experienced nicu nurses to set up, start, and monitor cveegs can decrease the time to initiate cveegs, which may lead to better seizure diagnosis

releases the endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern, hemoglobin (hb), into the plasma.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe redox-reactive hb generates cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, disrupting the redox balance and impairing the immune-responsive blood cells.\\tBACKGROUND\\ntherefore, it is crucial to understand how the immune system defends against the cytotoxic hb.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nwe identified a shortcut \"capture and quench\" mechanism of detoxification of hb by the monocyte scavenger receptor cd163, independent of the well-known dominant antioxidant, haptoglobin.\\tRESULTS\\nour findings support a highly efficient two-pass mechanism of detoxification and clearance of hb: 1) a direct suppression of hb-pseudoperoxidase activity by cd163, involving an autocrine loop of cd163 shedding, sequestration of hb, recycling, and homeostasis of cd163 in human monocytes and 2) paracrine transactivation of endothelial cells by the shedded soluble cd163 (scd163), which further detoxifies and clears residual hb.\\tRESULTS\\nwe showed that scd163 and igg interact with free hb in the plasma and subsequently the scd163-hb-igg complex is endocytosed into monocytes via fcgammar.\\tRESULTS\\nthe endocytosed scd163 is recycled to restore the homeostasis of cd163 on the monocyte membrane in an autocrine cycle, whereas the internalized hb is catabolized.\\tRESULTS\\nusing ex vivo coculture experiments, we demonstrated that the monocyte-derived scd163 and igg shuttle residual plasma hb into the proximal endothelial cells.\\tRESULTS\\nthese findings suggest that cd163 and igg collaborate to engage monocytes and endothelial cells in a two-pass detoxification mechanism to mount a systemic defense against hb-induced oxidative stress.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe immune system plays an important role in the breast cancer development.\\tBACKGROUND\\nox40l (also known as tnfsf4), a membrane protein, which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor super family binds to its receptor ox40 and this

examined.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nbecause it is established that development is correlated with reproductive modes in a number of features, we included comparison with taxa that represent the major reproductive modes and all of the modern normal tables and ossification sequences.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe embryos of c. orientalis most closely resemble those of stage 47/48 gegeneophis ramaswamii, an indian caeciliid, and stage 47/48 hypogeophis rostratus, a seychellian caeciliid, both direct developers, in details of bone mineralization, chondrocranial degeneration, and vertebrogenesis.\\tRESULTS\\nthey are most like stage 45 h. rostratus in external features (gills, pigmentation, etc.).\\tRESULTS\\nthey are less similar to prehatchings of ichthyophis kohtaoensis, an ichthyophiid with free-living

features.\\tRESULTS\\nthe similarity of developmental features among the direct-developers suggests a correlation with mode of life history.\\tRESULTS\\na noteworthy feature is that c. orientalis has an armature of multiple rows of teeth on the lower jaw with tooth crowns that resemble the \"fetal\" teeth of viviparous taxa and that are covered with a layer of oral mucosal epithelium until full development and eruption, but the upper jaw bears a single row of widely spaced, elongate, slightly recurved teeth that resemble those of the adult.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthere are minimal data regarding

diabetic rat bmscs, while the level of gsk3beta decreased to 43%.\\tRESULTS\\nin bmp2-induced type 2 diabetic bmscs with calcium phosphate cement (cpc) scaffolds for osteoblast study in vivo, the appearance of newly formed bone dramatically increased to 175% compared with type 2 diabetic bmscs.\\tRESULTS\\nthese data demonstrated that bmp2 enhanced bone regeneration in diabetic bmscs by stimulating the wnt signaling pathway with the accumulation of beta-catenin and the depressed expression of gsk3beta.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ndiabetic bmscs associated with bmp2 might be a potential tissue-engineered construct for bone defects in type 2 diabetes mellitus.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nunderstanding of the mechanisms of how food insecurity and poor physical and mental health status are interrelated with nutritional status among older adults is needed due to their unique health and social needs.\\tBACKGROUND\\nto examine the complex relationships between self-care capacity, depressive symptoms, food insecurity, and nutritional status among low-income older adults.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe cross-sectional study was conducted from february 2017 to may 2017.\\tMETHODS\\na total of 372 low-income older adults, 60 years of age and older, living in the state of alabama participated.\\tMETHODS\\nparticipants completed a validated survey measuring food insecurity (six-item us food security survey module), self-care capacity (self-care capacity scale), depressive symptoms (10-item geriatric depression scale), and nutritional status (mini nutritional assessment short-form).\\tMETHODS\\ngeneralized structural equation modeling was used to include the simultaneous equations and multiple mediators in one model.\\tMETHODS\\nthe akaike information criterion, bayesian information criterion, and likelihood ratio tests were conducted to compare the fit of competing model specifications.\\tMETHODS\\nlower self-care capacity was associated with greater food insecurity (beta [b]=.11, odds ratio [or]=1.11, p=0.03) and higher depressive symptoms (b=.08, p=0.005).\\tRESULTS\\npoorer self-care capacity and higher depressive symptoms were associated with poorer nutritional status (b=.24, or=1.27, p<0.001; b=.13, or=1.43, p=0.001, respectively).\\tRESULTS\\nhigher food insecurity was associated with increased depressive symptoms (b=.40, p<0.001).\\tRESULTS\\nself-care capacity was associated with nutritional status directly and indirectly through depressive symptoms (b=.04, p=0.048).\\tRESULTS\\nalthough food insecurity was not significantly associated with nutritional status, a significant indirect association between food insecurity and nutritional status through depressive symptoms was observed (b=.02, p=0.04).\\tRESULTS\\nstudy results indicate functionally impaired low-income older adults encounter greater food insecurity.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ninability to afford food combined with limited ability to take care of oneself contributes to an increased self-report of depressive symptoms, resulting in less favorable nutritional status.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe role of underlying genetic factors in the pathogenesis of nonsyndromic orofacial clefts (nsoc) remains poorly understood.\\tBACKGROUND\\nalthough genomewide association studies (gwass) of nsoc have successfully identified a large number of novel genetic risk loci, association results of replication studies are inconsistent across different populations.\\tBACKGROUND\\nsix single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) (rs7922405 at 10q26.3, rs73039426 at 19q13.11, rs7552 at 2p24.2, rs1788160 at 8q22.2, rs9381107 at 6p24.3, and rs17095681 at 10q25.3) were analyzed for an association with nsoc in 1062 participants of chinese descent (596 patients and 466 controls).\\tMETHODS\\nwe applied the multifactor dimensionality reduction (mdr) method to detect potential gene-gene (g x g) interactions in the six snps.\\tMETHODS\\nthe genotype or allele frequencies of snps rs7922405, rs73039426, and rs7552 showed significant differences between the controls and patients with nsoc, whereas no association was shown between three snps (rs1788160, rs17095681, and rs9381107) and nsoc.\\tRESULTS\\nmdr analysis did not reveal significant g x g interactions for susceptibility to nsoc.\\tRESULTS\\nwe confirmed that three genes (rs7922405 of mgmt, rs73039426 of rhpn2, and rs7552 of fam49a) may contribute to nsoc in chinese populations.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nmgmt and rhpn2 are associated with nsoc, which is herein demonstrated for the first time.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nto determine the effectiveness of simulation in improving staff confidence to provide safe patient care in a new or unfamiliar patient care area.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nhospitals undergo constant renovation to meet the needs of the populations they serve.\\tBACKGROUND\\nrelocating to a newly renovated care area can potentially impact patient safety through workflow process changes.\\tBACKGROUND\\nsimulated patient care scenarios were used to assess functionality of equipment and staff orientation to a newly renovated ward.\\tMETHODS\\nadditionally, staff confidence to provide safe patient care was assessed prior to patient relocation.\\tMETHODS\\nall participating staff reported feeling confident in their ability to provide safe patient care within the newly renovated ward at the conclusion of the exercise.\\tRESULTS\\nin this case study, the use of simulated patient care scenarios was successful to orientate staff to a new clinical space.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nadditionally, staff were able to identify workflow changes and access the functionality of newly installed equipment.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis exercise allowed staff to gain

fragmentation and open opportunities to improve patient care in terms of quality, economy and efficiency.\\tBACKGROUND\\nsince japan and germany are among the first countries strongly impacted by demographic changes of aging populations, we report on current developments about health information systems carrying out hie based on case studies in both countries.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nfour projects that address the improvement of hie within a defined region have been selected and investigated: the german project of the lower saxony bank of health and the japanese projects chiba itnet, nagasaki

in progress and all have to cope with significant challenges before they will be able to provide a fully working trans-institutional health network solution.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nprevious studies have shown that a subgroup of children with suspected (central) auditory processing disorder (suscapd) have insufficient ability to use binaural cues to benefit from spatial processing.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthus, they experience considerable listening difficulties in challenging auditory environments, such as classrooms.\\tBACKGROUND\\nsome researchers have also indicated the probable role of binaural temporal fine structure (tfs) in the perceptual segregation of target signal from noise and hence in speech perception in noise.\\tBACKGROUND\\ntherefore, in the present study, in order to further investigate the underlying reason for listening problems against background noise in this group of children, their performance was measured using binaural tfs sensitivity test (tfs-lf) as well as behavioral auditory lateralization in noise test, both of which are based on binaural temporal cues processing.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nparticipants in this analytical study included 91 children with normal hearing and no listening problems and 41 children (9-12 years old) with suscapd who found it challenging to understand speech in noise.\\tMETHODS\\ninitially, the ability to use binaural tfs was measured at three frequencies (250, 500 and 750hz) in both the groups, and the results of preliminary evaluations were compared between normal children and those with suscapd who participated in the study.\\tMETHODS\\nthereafter, the binaural performance of the 16 children with suscapd who had higher thresholds than the normal group at all three frequencies tested in tfs-lf test was examined using the lateralization test in 7 spatial locations.\\tMETHODS\\ntotal 16 of the 41 children with suscapd who participated in this study (39%) showed poor performance on the tfs-lf test at all three frequencies, compared to both normal children and other children in the apd group (p<0.05).\\tRESULTS\\nfurthermore, children in the apd group with binaural tfs coding deficits at all three frequencies revealed significant differences in the lateralization test results compared to normal children (p<0.05).\\tRESULTS\\nfindings of the current study demonstrated that one of the underlying causes for the difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments experienced by a subgroup of children with suscapd can be the reduced ability to benefit from binaural tfs information.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis study also showed that a reduced ability to use binaural tfs cues in the group of children with suscapd was accompanied by reduced binaural processing abilities in the lateralization test which also admit the presence of binaural temporal processing deficits in this group of children.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nheart failure readmissions are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\\tBACKGROUND\\nadequate education on adherence and self-care behaviours can affect readmission rates positively and nurses are at the frontline of patient education.\\tBACKGROUND\\nsuch education is valuable when establishing heart failure programmes in developing countries, in light of the challenging socioeconomic circumstances in these.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis study aimed to evaluate nurses\\' heart failure knowledge, to assess patients\\' baseline knowledge, and to evaluate the effectiveness of structured nurse-driven education.\\tOBJECTIVE\\na total of 131 cardiac centre-based nurses and 30 chronic heart failure patients participated in the study in kuwait.\\tMETHODS\\npatients were surveyed a second time 3 to 6 months later, while being followed at an advanced heart failure clinic by dedicated heart failure nurses.\\tMETHODS\\nthe majority of the nurses (80%) had not received heart failure education previously, although they were able to recognise most heart failure symptoms.\\tRESULTS\\nsignificant improvement in patients\\' knowledge was noted between the initial and follow-up surveys.\\tRESULTS\\nestablishing a dedicated advanced heart failure programme to care for patients in a developing country can result in significant improvement in disease awareness and self-care behaviours when led by well-trained heart failure nurses.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nmore research is needed to determine if these findings are shared by other countries in the middle-east and other developing countries.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe mutagenic effect of hepatitis b (hbv) integration in predisposing risk to hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) remains elusive.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin this study, we performed transcriptome sequencing of hbv-positive hcc cell lines and showed transcription of viral-human gene fusions from the site of genome integrations.\\tMETHODS\\nwe discovered tumor-promoting properties of a chimeric hbx-line1 that, intriguingly, functions as a hybrid rna.\\tRESULTS\\nhbx-line1 can be detected in 23.3% of hbv-associated hcc tumors and correlates with poorer patient survival.\\tRESULTS\\nhbx-line1 transgenic mice showed heightened susceptibility to diethylnitrosamine-induced tumor formation.\\tRESULTS\\nwe further show that hbx-line1 expression affects beta-catenin transactivity, which underlines a role in activating wnt signaling.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthus, this study identifies a viral-human chimeric fusion transcript that functions like a long noncoding rna to promote hcc.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe standard of care for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) has been developed based on studies that usually excluded patients with major comorbidities.\\tBACKGROUND\\nto describe treatments and outcomes according to comorbidities in patients with ards admitted to 19 icus (1997-2014).\\tOBJECTIVE\\npatients were grouped based on comorbidities.\\tMETHODS\\ndeterminants of day-28 mortality were identified by multivariable cox analysis stratified on center.\\tMETHODS\\namong 4953 ards patients, 2545 (51.4%) had major comorbidities; the proportion with major comorbidities increased after 2008.\\tRESULTS\\nhematological malignancy was associated with severe ards and rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia.\\tRESULTS\\ncopd, hiv infection, and hematological malignancy were associated with a lower likelihood of invasive mechanical ventilation on the admission day.\\tRESULTS\\nadmission-day sofa score was higher in patients with major comorbidities, who more often received vasopressors, dialysis, or treatment-limitation decisions.\\tRESULTS\\nday-28 mortality was 33.7% overall, 27.2% in patients without major comorbidities, and 31.1% (copd) to 56% (hematological malignancy) in patients with major comorbidities.\\tRESULTS\\nby multivariable analysis, mortality was lower in patients with copd and higher in those with chronic heart failure, solid tumors, or hematological malignancies.\\tRESULTS\\nmortality was independently associated with pao2/fio2 and paco2 on day 1, ards of pulmonary origin, worse sofa score, and icu-acquired events.\\tRESULTS\\nhalf the patients with ards had major comorbidities, which were associated with severe ards, multiple organ dysfunction, and day-28 mortality.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthese findings do not support the exclusion of ards patients with severe comorbidities from randomized clinical trials.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ntrials in ards patients with whatever comorbidities are warranted.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nto assess the biofilm inhibition activity of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (agnps) using curcuma longa.\\tOBJECTIVE\\ncharacterizations of

against both the strains under study.\\tRESULTS\\nc.longa mediated agnps showed potent antibiofilm activity.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nblockade of angiotensin ii type 1 receptor (at1) signaling attenuates heart failure following myocardial infarction (mi), perhaps through reduction of fibrosis in the noninfarcted myocardium.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever, its specific effect on the infarct tissue itself has not been fully clarified, which we examined in the present study.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nafter mi induction in mice, treatment with the at1 blocker olmesartan, beginning on the 3rd day post-mi, significantly improved survival (94%) 4 wk post-mi, compared with saline (53%) and hydralazine (73%).\\tMETHODS\\nolmesartan-treated mice also showed significant attenuation of left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction, as well as significantly greater infarct wall thickness, although the absolute size of the infarct scar was unchanged.\\tRESULTS\\nin addition, significantly greater numbers of nonmyocytes (mainly vascular cells and myofibroblasts) were present within the infarct scar in olmesartan-treated hearts.\\tRESULTS\\nten days post-mi, apoptosis among granulation tissue cells was significantly suppressed in the olmesartan-treated hearts, where expression of fas, bax, procaspase-3, and daxx and activation of caspase-3, c-jun nh(2)-terminal kinase, and c-jun were all significantly attenuated.\\tRESULTS\\nby contrast, expression of fas ligand, bcl-2, and fas-associated death domain and activation of caspase-8 were unaffected, suggesting olmesartan exerts a negative regulatory effect on the alternate pathway downstream of fas receptor.\\tRESULTS\\nin vitro, olmesartan dose-dependently inhibited fas-mediated apoptosis in granulation tissue-derived myofibroblasts.\\tRESULTS\\nthe present study proposes this antiapoptotic effect as another important mechanism for an at1 blocker in improving post-mi ventricular remodeling, as well as its antifibrotic effect, and also suggests a significant link between renin-angiotensin and fas/fas ligand systems in postinfarction hearts.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nas rates of suicide continue to rise, there is

were increased by day 6 compared to calves infected with ncp bvdv-2.\\tRESULTS\\nthese results demonstrated that the korean ncp bvdv-2 isolate shows a reduced ifn-gamma production, indicating prevention of the antiviral activity, and therefore promotes the development of pathological effects.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (mibc) is an aggressive disease for which treatment strategies are continuously evolving.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe characterized trends in treatment modalities for mibc from 2004 to 2013 (the \"pre-immunotherapy era\") and identified predictors of receiving the current standard of care treatment: neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nac) followed by radical cystectomy (rc).\\tOBJECTIVE\\nwe used the national cancer database to identify individuals diagnosed with clinically localized mibc from 2004 to 2013.\\tMETHODS\\nwe calculated the yearly prevalence of nac followed by rc, rc as first treatment, trimodal therapy, chemotherapy and/or radiation alone, and no treatment.\\tMETHODS\\nwe then identified factors associated with receiving nac prior to rc.\\tMETHODS\\nthere was a notable increase in the use of nac followed by rc over the study period, from 3.68% in 2004 to 14.83% in 2013 (p < 0.001).\\tRESULTS\\nfactors associated with decreased odds of receiving this regimen included being older, black, uninsured, less educated, and more burdened by comorbidities.\\tRESULTS\\nrates of trimodal therapy and chemotherapy and/or radiation alone remained relatively constant (approximately 5 and 17%, respectively).\\tRESULTS\\nthere was a consistent decline in the proportion of patients who did not receive any treatment, down to 34.20% in 2013.\\tRESULTS\\ntrends in localized mibc treatment have evolved substantially since the early 2000s, and certain patient characteristics are associated with lower odds of receiving the current standard of care.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis serves as a foundation from which to judge the impact of the upcoming immunotherapy era on the treatment landscape for this disease.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ndengue is a febrile illness transmitted by mosquitoes, causing disease across the tropical and sub-tropical

comparative, interventional, and immunohistochemical study.\\tMETHODS\\nforty-five eyes from 45 patients with idiopathic epiretinal membrane (erm) underwent pars plana chromovitrectomy with erm and inner limiting membrane (ilm) using trypan blue 0.15% + brilliant blue 0.05% + lutein 2% in group 1 (15 eyes), trypan blue 0.15% + brilliant blue 0.025% + polyethylene glycol 3350 4% in group 2 (15 eyes), and indocyanine green 0.05% in group 3 (15 eyes).\\tMETHODS\\nwe evaluated visual acuity (va) and macular sensitivity (ms) preoperatively, 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery.\\tMETHODS\\nthe expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) and neurofilament protein (nf) was assessed immunohistochemically on the ilms peeled as markers of glial and neuronal cells.\\tMETHODS\\nin group 1, both mean va and ms were significantly better at 1 and 3 months after surgery (p < 0.05), whereas no significant difference was found after 6 months.\\tRESULTS\\ngfap and nf expression was significantly lower in group 1 (p < 0.05).\\tRESULTS\\nthe erm/ilm peeling is thought to rip off the intraretinal tissue, based on the amounts of gfap and nf in the specimens.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe use of lutein dyes reduces iatrogenic stress to the retinal tissue and allows a faster functional recovery in the first 3 months after surgery, suggesting a less iatrogenic adhesion to the retinal tissue.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nfor gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms (gnen), the current ajcc lymph node (n) stage classifies patients into n0/n1 disease (with/without locoregional nodal metastases); however,

backward speech in 20-second blocks separated by 20-second periods of no sound presentation.\\tMETHODS\\ntoddlers produced significantly greater activation in frontal, occipital, and cerebellar regions than 3-year-old children in response to forward speech.\\tRESULTS\\nour results suggest that rapid language acquisition during the second year of life may require the utilization of frontal, cerebellar, and occipital regions in addition to classical superior temporal language areas.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthese findings are consistent with the interactive specialization hypothesis, which proposes that cognitive abilities develop from the interaction of brain regions that include and extend beyond those used in the adult brain.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nanthracyclines are antineoplastic agents that are effective against solid tumors and hematological malignancies.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever, drug-induced cardiotoxicity imposes dose limitations.\\tBACKGROUND\\nmyocardial damage due to anthracyclines has been assessed by measuring left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) or fraction shortening (fs) by echocardiography and criteria for discontinuing treatment have been established based on these indexes.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever, cardiotoxicity is already irreversible when either lvef or fs fulfills these criteria.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe tei-index has recently been established to assess combined systolic and diastolic myocardial function during echocardiography.\\tBACKGROUND\\nit can also detect small changes in cardiac function.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe therefore surmised that the tei-index would reflect early myocardial damage induced by anthracyclines.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nwe treated 23 patients with the anthracycline, doxorubicin (dxr), and examined them at least twice during the treatment.\\tMETHODS\\nan additional dose of dxr significantly correlated with a change in the tei-index (deltatei-index).\\tRESULTS\\nin contrast, a change in lvef did not correlate with increased doses of dxr.\\tRESULTS\\nthe deltatei-index did not correlate with either lvef or the tei-index before treatment.\\tRESULTS\\nthese results suggested that the deltatei-index is a more sensitive indicator of early cardiotoxicity induced by anthracyclines than lvef regardless of its value before treatment.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nrheumatology and dermatology are two medical disciplines, which are

experimental implants was 41.44%.\\tRESULTS\\nin particular, the bic% for m1 was 39.72%, for m2 it was 43.97%, and for m3 - 40.63%; in the control group it was 49.63% and 27.77% for ceramic and titanium control implants, respectively.\\tRESULTS\\nthe intra-group analysis showed no statistically important differences between the bic values for implants in any group.\\tRESULTS\\nhowever, the analysis of bic for different regions of the same implant showed statistically significant differences in all of the groups between the results of the threaded region and the neck and the apex.\\tRESULTS\\nthe results of our study suggest that zirconia implants with modified surfaces display features of osseointegration similar to those of titanium implants.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthese

cyclists to detect an improvement in dynamic comfort.\\tRESULTS\\ndynamic bicycle comfort can be measured in terms of a new metric: power transmitted to the cyclist.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nin eukaryotes, the creation of ligatable nicks in dna from flap structures generated by dna polymerase delta-catalyzed displacement dna synthesis during okazaki fragment processing depends on the combined action of fen1 and dna2.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthese two enzymes contain partially overlapping but distinct endonuclease activities.\\tBACKGROUND\\ndna2 is well-suited to process long flaps, which are converted to nicks by the subsequent action of fen1.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin this report, we purified human dna2 as a recombinant protein from human cells transfected with the cdna of the human homologue of saccharomyces

hydrocephalus can be treated with cerebrospinal fluid shunts, usually to the peritoneal cavity or to the right cardiac atrium.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever, due to their siphoning effect, these shunts lead to non-physiological cerebrospinal fluid drainage, with possible co-morbidity and high revision rates.\\tBACKGROUND\\nmore sophisticated shunt valve systems significantly increase costs and technical complexity and remain unsuccessful in a subgroup of patients.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin an attempt to obtain physiological cerebrospinal fluid shunting, many neurosurgical pioneers shunted towards the dural sinuses, taking advantage of the physiological anti-siphoning effect of the internal jugular veins.\\tBACKGROUND\\ndespite several promising reports, the ventriculosinus shunts did not yet become standard neurosurgical practice.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin this mono-centric prospective clinical study, we implanted the retrograde ventriculosinus shunt, as advocated by el-shafei, in 10 patients.\\tMETHODS\\nthis article reports on our operation technique and long-term outcome, including 4 patients in whom this shunt was implanted as a rescue.\\tMETHODS\\nimplantation of a

ventriculosinus shunt was maintained during more than 6 years follow-up.\\tRESULTS\\nin our opinion, these shunts fail because present venous access devices are difficult to implant correctly and get

circumstances to accomplish the task of walking.\\tBACKGROUND\\nfor instance, subjects spontaneously increase leg compliance at a step length threshold as step length increases.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhere we test the hypothesis that this transition occurs based on the level of energy expenditure, where compliant walking becomes less energetically demanding at long step lengths.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nto map and compare the metabolic cost of normal and compliant walking as step length increases.\\tOBJECTIVE\\n10 healthy individuals walked on a treadmill using progressively increasing step lengths (100%, 120%, 140% and 160% of preferred step length), in both normal and compliant leg walking as energy expenditure was recorded via indirect calorimetry.\\tMETHODS\\nleg compliance was controlled by lowering the center-of-mass trajectory during stance, forcing the leg to flex and extend as the body moved over the foot contact.\\tMETHODS\\nfor normal step lengths, compliant leg walking was more costly than normal walking gait, but compliant leg walking energetic cost did not increase as rapidly for longer step lengths.\\tRESULTS\\nthis led to an intersection between normal and compliant walking cost curves at 114% relative step length (regression analysis; r(2)=0.92 for normal walking; r(2)=0.65 for compliant walking).\\tRESULTS\\ncompliant leg walking is less energetically demanding at longer step lengths where a spontaneous shift to compliant walking has been observed, suggesting the human motor control system is sensitive to energetic requirements and will employ alternate movement patterns if advantageous strategies are available.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe transition could be attributed to the interplay between (i) leg work controlling body travel during single stance and (ii) leg work to control energy loss in the step-to-step transition.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ncompliant leg walking requires more stance leg work at normal step lengths, but involves less energy loss at the step-to-step transition for very long steps.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nsingle photon emission computed tomography (spect) is obtained by the injection of one of a series of compounds that cross the blood-brain

melanocytic nevi including 59 cbn, 34 ordinary blue nevi, 87 combined nevi (including 43 so-called clonal nevi), 35 deep penetrating nevi, and 60 ordinary compound and dermal nevi (30 of each) were studied for the presence of so-called ball-in-mitts and microalveolar structures.\\tOBJECTIVE\\na ball-in-mitts structure was defined as a single centrally placed melanocyte with a round to oval nucleus (the \"ball\" cell) and a clear, dusty, or pigmented cytoplasm encircled by a single dendritic cell (the \"mitt\" cell) with an oval to spindle-shaped nucleus and slender bipolar processes containing melanin and surrounding at least one fourth of the ball\\'s diameter.\\tMETHODS\\na microalveolar structure was defined as a group of 2 to 10 centrally placed melanocytes with round to oval nuclei and clear, dusty, or pigmented cytoplasm (balls) surrounded by one or more cells (mitts) with spindle-shaped nuclei and slender bipolar processes containing melanin.\\tMETHODS\\nmicroscopically, ball-in-mitt and microalveolar structures were detected in all types of nevi studied, with the highest incidence in combined nevi (82%), cbn (76%), and ordinary \"nonblue\" nevi (73%).\\tRESULTS\\nin cbn, ball-in-mitts and microalveolar structures tended to be located in the deeper portion of the lesions, whereas in ordinary nonblue nevi, they were most often found superficially, just below the epidermis; in clonal nevi, these structures were often confined to the \"clonal\" parts.\\tRESULTS\\nimmunohistochemically, ball-in-mitts and microalveolar structures were positive for hmb45.\\tRESULTS\\nultrastructurally, the balls tended to have round to oval nuclei, whereas the mitts possessed oval, elongated to spindled nuclei.\\tRESULTS\\nmelanosomes were found in various stages in the cells of both structures.\\tRESULTS\\nthe cytoplasm of the mitts typically formed elongated polar processes, sometimes with club-like widenings at the ends, completely or partially encircling the balls.\\tRESULTS\\nin the microalveolar structures, the adjacent cells forming the mitts surrounded the ball cells like a chain.\\tRESULTS\\nour study suggests that some or even most cases of cbn may evolve from ordinary nonblue nevi.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis process may involve several steps and is probably reflected by the appearances of combined nevi, deep penetrating nevi, and cbn.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthese nevi often show a morphological overlap, and ball-in-mitts and microalveolar structures found in various stages of their development seem to greatly account for this overlap.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nmirnas are a class of endogenous non-coding rna, which can regulate downstream target genes through binding to the 3\\'utr

various cancers, including colorectal cancer.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhere, we show that mir-31 is upregulated in human colon cancer tissues and cell lines, and that repression of mir-31 inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agarose.\\tRESULTS\\nto further elucidate the mechanism underlying the role of mir-31 in promoting colon cancer, we used online mirna target prediction databases and found that the tumor suppressor rhotbt1 may be a target of mir-31.\\tMETHODS\\nimunohistochemistry assay revealed that rhobtb1 was significantly decreased in ht29 cells.\\tRESULTS\\nin addition, ectopic expression of mir-31 reduced rhobtb1 in the colon cancer cell line ht29.\\tRESULTS\\nthe results suggested that suppression of rhobtb1 may be responsible for colon tumorigenesis, which was inhibited directly by mir-31.\\tRESULTS\\nthe results of mtt and soft agarose colony-formation assays showed that knockdown of rhobtb1 by rnai induced cell proliferation, and colony formation in soft agarose, which mimicked the function of mir-31.\\tRESULTS\\nthis further suggested that suppression of rhobtb1 was responsible for colon tumorigenesis.\\tRESULTS\\nin conclusion, we found that mir-31 acts as an oncogene in colon cancer and identified rhobtb1 as a new target of mir-31 further study demonstrated that mir-31 contributed to the development of colon cancer at least partly by targeting rhobtb1.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe serve-hf study has raised questions concerning the higher mortality under adaptive servoventilation.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe ventilatory mode was discussed

medical costs were attributed to psoriasis and psa.\\tRESULTS\\nalthough persistent patients incurred higher pharmacy costs ($10,684 vs. $7,849; p < 0.001) due to higher biologic use and the potentially high per-unit cost of biologics, their psoriasis- and/or psa-related medical costs were significantly lower than those of nonpersistent patients ($3,395 vs. $5,041; p < 0.001).\\tRESULTS\\ntotal overall costs combining medical and pharmacy costs were similar between the cohorts ($22,678 vs. $21,477; p = 0.122).\\tRESULTS\\nmoderate to severe psoriasis and/or psa patients who were persistent on index biologic treatment had higher pharmacy utilization and costs, albeit with lower medical costs and similar total costs, compared with nonpersistent

neutrophils actively destroy invading microorganisms via a potent antimicrobial arsenal composed of oxidants and antimicrobial peptides.\\tBACKGROUND\\npsoriasin, an escherichia coli-cidal antimicrobial protein, has been found to be overexpressed in psoriasis, a skin disease characterized by infiltration of neutrophils.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin addition to its microbicidal activities and chemotaxis of neutrophils reported previously, we hypothesized that psoriasin might regulate other neutrophil functions such as cytokine and chemokine production, reactive oxygen species generation, and release of antimicrobial peptides.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nin the current study, we demonstrate that psoriasin activates neutrophils to produce a range of cytokines and chemokines including interleukin-6 (il-6), il-8/cxcl8, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (mip-1alpha)/ccl3, mip-1beta/ccl4 and mip-3alpha/ccl20.\\tRESULTS\\nfurthermore, psoriasin induces phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk), but not c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk), both of which are required for the production of cytokines and chemokines as evidenced by the inhibitory effects of p38 and erk inhibitors on psoriasin-mediated neutrophil activation.\\tRESULTS\\nmoreover, psoriasin stimulates the generation of reactive oxygen species from neutrophils, most likely via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activation.\\tRESULTS\\nfinally, we demonstrate that psoriasin enhances messenger rna expression of alpha-defensins, termed human neutrophil peptides (hnp) 1 to 3, and induces their extracellular release.\\tRESULTS\\nbesides its antimicrobial properties, therefore, psoriasin may contribute to innate immunity through enhancing neutrophil host defence functions at sites of inflammation or infection.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nisotopic tracers have been used to examine lipid trafficking for many years, and data from those studies have typically yielded novel insight regarding the pathophysiology of dyslipidemia.\\tBACKGROUND\\nprevious experimental designs were suitable for studies in humans because relatively large volumes of plasma could be regularly sampled.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe have expanded on the earlier logic by applying high-throughput analytical methods that require reduced sample volumes.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nspecifically, we have examined the possibility of coupling gel-based separations of lipoproteins (e.g., lipoprint) with lc-ms/ms analyses of complex lipid mixtures as a way to routinely measure the labeling profiles of distinct lipids in discrete lipoprotein subfractions.\\tMETHODS\\nwe demonstrate the ability to measure the incorporation of [u-(13)c]oleate into triglycerides (tg), pls (pl), and cholesterol esters (ce) in vldl, ldl, and hdl particles in mice.\\tRESULTS\\nalthough rodent models of dyslipidemia are inherently different from humans because of alterations in enzyme activities and underlying metabolism, rodent models can be used to screen novel compounds for efficacy in altering a given biochemical pathway and therein enable studies of target engagement in vivo.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nwe expect that it is possible to translate our approach for application in other systems, including studies in humans.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nreliable reference intervals for serum progastrin-releasing peptide (progrp) in healthy chinese adults with electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (eclia) are still lacking in

a nonparametric method.\\tMETHODS\\nin an apparently healthy chinese population, the reference intervals for serum progrp with eclia were 53.92 ng/l for adults aged 21-70 years and 75.69 ng/l for adults aged >70 years, respectively.\\tRESULTS\\nthe reference values for serum progrp with eclia in an apparently healthy chinese population were established according to the clsi c28-a3 document,

analysis has been conducted on studies focusing on the cardiovascular (cv) profile of women who performed this activity.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe aim of this systematic review is to provide insights into the impact of zf on women\\'s cv health.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nfive clinical databases were searched.\\tMETHODS\\nto be included, the articles had to include (1) women with or without cv risk factors (cvrf) and (2) cv-related outcomes resulting from a zf program.\\tMETHODS\\nten studies (322 women; 181 healthy, 141 with cvrf) were included.\\tRESULTS\\nin healthy women, low absolute effect sizes for maximal oxygen uptake (vo2max), anthropometric and body composition profile after 8 and 12 wk of zf were found compared with nonparticipants.\\tRESULTS\\nmoderate to large absolute effect sizes were recorded for vo2max and body composition following 40 wk of zf.\\tRESULTS\\nfindings proved promising but less consistent for zf studies involving women with cvrf due to the absence of control groups.\\tRESULTS\\ndata describe zf as feasible for healthy women and a promising fitness option for those with cvrf.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nbecause of the low quality of the studies on women with cvrf and the overall small sample size along with discrepancies such as the average length of the studies on healthy women, cautious interpretation of the findings is recommended.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nfurther investigations with a standardized design are needed to verify whether zf may be considered as an alternative fitness option in primary prevention of cv disease in women.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\na cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey of leishmaniasis was carried out among children and adults from four villages and one district of denizli province located in the southern aegean region of turkey where 14 human visceral leishmaniasis (hvl) cases including 4 adults were reported between 1993 and 2000.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nblood samples were taken from 329 children, 217 adults and 140 dogs and a physical examination was also done.\\tMETHODS\\nindirect fluorescent antibody test and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay were performed for all sera.\\tMETHODS\\nall 329 sera collected from children were found to be negative while 2 (0.09%) out of 217 adult sera were found to be seropositive.\\tRESULTS\\none seropositive adult patient was confirmed parasitologically as hvl after bone marrow aspiration and treated with ambisome while the other was followed only serologically because of the absence of symptoms.\\tRESULTS\\nthe overall canine leishmaniasis seroprevalence was found to be 20.7%.\\tRESULTS\\nsand flies were collected using cdc light traps in three out of five study sites and midguts of females were checked for promastigotes after

43.52% and 37.35%, respectively.\\tRESULTS\\nno promastigotes were found in the midgut specimens.\\tRESULTS\\nin addition, the results showed the presence of vector sand fly species, as well as a high seroprevalence of anti-leishmania antibodies among dogs from rural and a suburban area of denizli province with a large proportion of asymptomatic seropositive dogs.\\tRESULTS\\nrapidly rising temperatures are expected to cause latitudinal and elevational range shifts as species track their optimal climate north and upward.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever, a lack of adaptation to environmental conditions other than climate - for example photoperiod, biotic interactions, or edaphic conditions - might limit the success of immigrants in a new location despite hospitable climatic conditions.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhere, we present one of the first direct experimental tests of the hypothesis that warmer temperatures at northern latitudes will confer a fitness advantage to southern immigrants relative to native populations.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nas rates of warming in the arctic are more than double the global average, understanding the impacts of warming in arctic ecosystems is especially urgent.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nwe established experimentally warmed and nonwarmed common garden plots at alexandra fiord, ellesmere island in the canadian high arctic with seeds of two forb species (oxyria digyna and papaver radicatum) originating from three to five populations at different latitudes across the arctic.\\tMETHODS\\nwe found that plants from the local populations generally had higher survival and obtained a greater maximum size than foreign individuals, regardless of warming treatment.\\tRESULTS\\nphenological traits varied with latitude of the source population, such that southern populations demonstrated substantially delayed leaf-out and senescence relative to northern populations.\\tRESULTS\\nour results suggest that environmental conditions other than temperature may influence the ability of foreign populations and species to establish at more northerly latitudes as the climate warms, potentially leading to lags in northward range shifts for some species.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nin assessing hazard for human health posed by newly engineered nanomaterials (enm), approaches such as weight of evidence (woe) and expert judgment are required to develop conclusions about the hazard of enm.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis is because all factors affecting hazard are not currently well defined and are often subject to different interpretation.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhere we report the application of a woe procedure to assess the potential of enm to cause harm for human health, by integrating and combining physicochemical properties of nm and toxicity data obtained within the eu-funded particle risk project.\\tMETHODS\\nthe procedure was applied to carbon black (cb), single-walled carbon nanotubes (swnt), c60 fullerene and quantum dots (qd) enm tested during the particle risk project.\\tMETHODS\\nthe results show that some of the investigated enm present a relatively higher hazardousness level on the basis of the integration of their physicochemical properties and toxicological effects, and that their hazard may be ranked as follow: qd >> c60 > swnt > cb.\\tRESULTS\\nthis case study shows the utility of woe approach to obtain a hazard ranking of enm.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nto investigate the efficacy and safety of estradiol valerate (ev)/dienogest (dng) for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding (hmb) in asian and non-asian women desiring

endpoint was the absolute change in menstrual blood loss (mbl) volume between the run-in and efficacy phases (90 days each).\\tMETHODS\\nsecondary endpoints included the proportion of women with successful treatment (i.e., no episodes of mbl >/=80 ml and a decrease of <50% in mbl), percent change in mbl from the run-in phase, and change in hemoglobin and serum ferritin

occurrence.\\tBACKGROUND\\nalthough there is consensus that a calcaneal spur is a common cause of heel pain, approximately 20% of calcaneal spurs are asymptomatic and its pathology remains not fully understood.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin this report, we present a rare case of a very large and bizarre calcaneal spur in a young adult man.\\tMETHODS\\nthe calcaneal spur was painful, which affected his foot function and was associated with plantar fasciitis.\\tMETHODS\\nthe spur length was measured in the radiograph and exhibited the longest calcaneal spur reported in the literature.\\tMETHODS\\nthe patient was treated conservatively, and he fully recovered his foot function.\\tMETHODS\\nthis case was unique because although the patient presented with an extremely large unilateral calcaneal spur, he was young and did not have any chronic disease; hence, he was treated conservatively.\\tRESULTS\\nthe pain subsided and he regained full function of his foot.\\tRESULTS\\nthis case questions the association between calcaneal spur length and plantar fasciitis symptoms.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis case confirms that the length of calcaneal spurs, even extremely long ones, is not associated with the pathology of plantar fasciitis and that surgical treatment is not necessary.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ndespite varied non-surgical alternatives for the treatment of osteoarthritis, many patients remain symptomatic.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin the last decade, the use of intra-articular platelet-rich plasma (prp) has been proposed as an option.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever, there is controversy about its clinical benefit and safety.\\tBACKGROUND\\nto answer this question we used epistemonikos, the largest database of systematic reviews in health, which is maintained by screening multiple information sources, including medline, embase, cochrane, among others.\\tMETHODS\\nwe extracted data from the systematic reviews, reanalyzed data of primary studies, conducted a meta-analysis and generated a summary of findings table using the grade approach.\\tMETHODS\\nwe identified twelve systematic reviews including four studies overall, of which all corresponded to randomized trials.\\tRESULTS\\nwe concluded that intra-articular injection of platelet-rich plasma might slightly decrease joint pain and improve patient satisfaction,vut it is not clear whether it has any effect on functionality because the certainty of the evidence is very low.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nas for the adverse effects, if they exist, they would be non-severe and self-limited.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe association between the checkpoint kinase 2*1100delc (chek2*1100delc) and breast cancer has been extensively explored.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin light of the recent publication of studies on these specific findings, particularly regarding male

indicator of cancer center performance for high-quality cancer care.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe examined regional variation in performance for commission on cancer breast quality measures and its impact on overall survival (os) for those measures that have been shown to impact os.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nsix breast quality measures were analyzed using the national cancer data base from 2014 to 2015, and a multivariable model was used to assess performance for each measure by region.\\tMETHODS\\nkaplan-meier and cox proportional hazard models were used to examine os between high- and low-performing centers from 2007 to 2012.\\tMETHODS\\noverall, 305,391 women had surgery at 1322 institutions in nine us regions; 90.8% underwent needle biopsy (range 86.0-92.6% between regions, p < 0.01), 69.8% had breast-conserving surgery (bcs) for stage 0-ii cancer (60.9-79.3%, p < 0.01), 85.2% aged < 70 years had radiation therapy (rt) after bcs (79.6-90.8%, p < 0.01), 78.3% of women with four or more positive nodes had post-mastectomy rt (70.9-84.5%, p < 0.01), 90.9% with hormone receptor (hr)-positive stage ib-iii cancer had hormone therapy (83.7-95.1%, p < 0.01), and 89.4% aged < 70 years with

of non-compliance across measures.\\tRESULTS\\nwith median 65-month follow-up, there was no difference in os between high- and low-performing centers for the three measures that have been shown to impact os.\\tRESULTS\\nthere is significant regional variation in performance on the breast quality measures but this variation did not impact os.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ntargeted efforts in certain areas of

literature on the exact role of coherent light in the biochemical reaction of the whitening process is very discordant.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe aims of this in vitro study were: (1) to compare two different laser sources, a ktp laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and a diode laser with a wavelength of 808 nm, during dental bleaching, and (2) to investigate the relationships among changes in gel temperature, tooth shade and hydrogen peroxide (hp) concentration during laser irradiation.\\tOBJECTIVE\\naltogether, 116 bovine teeth were bleached using a 30% hp gel, some of them with gel only and others with gel plus one of the two lasers (532 or 808 nm) at two different powers (2 and 4 w).\\tMETHODS\\nthe ktp laser produced a significant shade variation with a minimal temperature increase.\\tMETHODS\\nthe diode laser led to a higher temperature increase with a greater reduction in hp concentration, but the change in shade was only statistically significant with a power of 4 w.\\tRESULTS\\nat a power of 2 w, the ktp laser caused a greater change in shade than the diode laser.\\tRESULTS\\nno significant correlations were found among temperature, hp concentration and shade variation.\\tRESULTS\\nthe ktp laser appears to provide better results with less dangerous thermal increases than the diode laser.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis might call into question most of the literature affirming that the action of laser bleaching is by increasing the gel temperature and, consequently, the speed of the redox reaction.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nfurther study is required to investigate the correlations between the parameters investigated and efficacy of the bleaching process.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nlittle is known about the clinical characteristics and health-related quality of life (hqol) of

ionizing radiation leads to premature cell senescence and suppression of cell proliferation.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin contrast, low dose and low dose-rate gamma-irradiation can lead to stimulation of cell proliferation.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe aimed to examine whether the low dose radiation-induced proliferation of normal human fibroblasts can lead to a progressive depletion of proliferation potential and to an early onset of senescence.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nnormal human embryonic lung fibroblasts (helf-104) at passage 22-24 were gamma-irradiated with doses of 0 (sham-irradiation), 10, 30, 50, 90, 120, 150, 200,

(m1) is hardly known.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe used real-time eeg-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) of m1 to characterize the relationship between spontaneous sensorimotor mu-alpha power fluctuations at rest and corticospinal excitability.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nin 16 subjects, mu-alpha power was continuously monitored over the left sensorimotor cortex, and each 10%-percentile bin of the individual mu-alpha power distribution was repeatedly targeted in pseudorandomized order by single-pulse tms of left m1, measuring motor evoked potentials (mep) in the contralateral hand.\\tMETHODS\\nwe found a weak positive relationship between mu-alpha power and mep amplitude.\\tRESULTS\\nsensorimotor mu-alpha power may reflect a net facilitation or disinhibition of m1,

schizophrenia.\\tBACKGROUND\\nclassical antipsychotic drugs modulate information processing in cortico-limbic circuits via dopamine d2 receptor blockade in nucleus accumbens (nac) whereas atypical antipsychotic drugs preferentially target cortical serotonin (5-ht) receptors.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe brain networks involved in the therapeutic action of atypical drugs are not fully understood.\\tBACKGROUND\\nprevious work indicated that medial pfc (mpfc) pyramidal neurons projecting to ventral tegmental area express 5-ht2a receptors suggesting that atypical antipsychotic drugs modulate dopaminergic activity distally, via 5-ht2a receptor (5-ht2a-r) blockade in pfc.\\tBACKGROUND\\nsince the mpfc also projects heavily to nac, we examined whether nac-projecting pyramidal neurons also express 5-ht2a-r.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nusing a combination of retrograde tracing experiments and in situ hybridization we report that a substantial proportion of mpfc-nac pyramidal neurons in rat brain express 5-ht2a-r mrna in a layer- and area-specific manner (up to 68% in layer v of contralateral cingulate).\\tMETHODS\\nthe functional relevance of 5-ht2a-r to modulate mpfc-nac projections was examined in dual-probe microdialysis experiments.\\tMETHODS\\nthe application of the preferential 5-ht2a-r agonist doi into mpfc enhanced glutamate release locally (+66 +/- 18%) and in nac (+74 +/- 12%) indicating that cortical 5-ht2a-r activation augments glutamatergic transmission in nac.\\tRESULTS\\nsince nac integrates glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs, blockade of 5-ht2a-r by atypical drugs may reduce cortical excitatory inputs onto gabaergic neurons of nac, adding to dopamine d2 receptor blockade.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ntogether with previous observations, the present results suggest that atypical antipsychotic drugs may control the activity of the mesolimbic pathway at cell body and terminal level.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe 2-fold purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of acid etching and calcium chloride immersion on removal torque and the bone-cutting ability of orthodontic mini-implants (omis).\\tOBJECTIVE\\nfor the removal torque part of the study, 3 types of omis (titanium alloy) were evaluated in a rabbit model: omis with acid surface etching with and without calcium chloride immersion (ecg and eg, respectively) and a control group (cg), in which the omis had an untreated, machined surface.\\tMETHODS\\nwe inserted 126 omis (42 omis per type) into both tibias of 21 male rabbits (5 months of age) with body weights of 3.0 to 3.5 kg.\\tMETHODS\\nremoval torque was evaluated after 1, 4, and 7 weeks.\\tMETHODS\\nto determine the omis\\' bone-cutting ability, total insertion time to place an omi 6 mm into artificial bone was measured (6 omis per group).\\tMETHODS\\nremoval torque values for the eg (3.97 +/- 0.52 ncm) and ecg (4.21 +/- 0.44 ncm) were statistically and significantly higher than those of the cg (3.02 +/- 0.53 ncm) 1 week after implantation (p <0.05).\\tRESULTS\\nthe ecg (6.54 +/- 0.50, 6.61 +/- 0.66 ncm) showed the highest removal torque value followed by the eg (5.68 +/- 0.58, 5.89 +/- 0.70 ncm) and cg (3.43 +/- 0.62, 3.38 +/- 0.54 ncm) at 4 and 7 weeks after implantation (p <0.05).\\tRESULTS\\nremoval torque did not change over time with the cg, but with the ecg and eg, it was significantly higher in weeks 4 and 7 than in week 1 (p <0.05).\\tRESULTS\\ntotal insertion time was significantly greater for the eg than for the ecg and cg (p <0.05).\\tRESULTS\\ntreating omis with a calcium chloride solution improved the initial bone reaction by preventing contamination of the implant surface, and increasing the surface roughness of omis by acid etching enhanced their stability without decreasing the bone-cutting ability compared with omis without surface treatment.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nginkgo leaf tablets (glts) and losartan are often simultaneously used for the treatment of

prolonged significantly from 3.94 +/- 0.62 to 4.75 +/- 0.52 h (p < 0.05).\\tRESULTS\\nthe metabolic stability of losartan was increased from 37.4 min to 59.6 min with glt pretreatment.\\tRESULTS\\nthe results indicate that glt might increase the plasma concentration of losartan and decrease the concentration of exp3174 through inhibiting the metabolism of losartan.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\n5-fluorouracil

have been used to evaluate chondroid lipomas, imaging cannot accurately differentiate chondroid lipoma from sarcoma.\\tBACKGROUND\\na 39-year-old man presented to a local clinic with a 1-month history of a painless mass in his left neck.\\tMETHODS\\nresults of a needle biopsy suggested an atypical lipomatous tumor, and the patient was referred to our hospital.\\tMETHODS\\nphysical examination revealed a hard and mobile mass in the left neck.\\tMETHODS\\nplain x-ray radiographs showed an absence of calcification in the soft tissue mass.\\tMETHODS\\nmri revealed a well-defined and lobulated mass, and on t1-weighted images, the lesion showed heterogeneity, with higher signal intensity than that of muscle.\\tMETHODS\\non t2-weighted images, the septum had low-signal intensity.\\tMETHODS\\non t2-weighted fat-suppressed images, the signal of the mass was completely suppressed.\\tMETHODS\\nthe suvmax of the mass on fdg pet was 1.84.\\tMETHODS\\nan additional needle biopsy was performed, and on the basis of the results, we arrived at a diagnosis of well-differentiated liposarcoma.\\tMETHODS\\nthe mass was resected marginally.\\tMETHODS\\nmacroscopically, the mass was encapsulated and markedly harder than well-differentiated liposarcoma.\\tMETHODS\\nhistologically, the tumor was composed of myxoid and cartilaginous matrix, and mature fat cells and lipoblast-like cells were present.\\tMETHODS\\nthe final diagnosis was chondroid lipoma, and no recurrence was observed 1 year after surgery.\\tMETHODS\\nchondroid lipoma is an extremely rare benign soft tissue tumor that is often confused with sarcoma.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nit is very important to differentiate chondroid lipoma from sarcoma when the suvmax value of the mass is low, even when biopsy results suggest that it is a sarcoma.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nnon-invasive imaging can provide essential information for the optimization of new drug delivery-based bone regeneration strategies to repair damaged or impaired bone tissue.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis study investigates the applicability of nuclear medicine and radiological techniques to monitor growth factor retention profiles and subsequent effects on bone formation.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nrecombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (bmp-2, 6.5 microg/scaffold) was incorporated into a sustained release vehicle consisting of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres embedded in a poly(propylene fumarate) scaffold surrounded by a gelatin hydrogel and implanted subcutaneously and in 5-mm segmental femoral defects in 9 rats for a period of 56 days.\\tMETHODS\\nto determine the pharmacokinetic profile, bmp-2 was radiolabeled with (125)i and the local retention of (125)i-bmp-2 was measured by single photon emission computed tomography (spect), scintillation probes and ex vivo scintillation analysis.\\tMETHODS\\nbone formation was monitored by micro-computed tomography (microct).\\tMETHODS\\nthe scaffolds released bmp-2 in a sustained fashion over the 56-day implantation period.\\tMETHODS\\na good correlation between the spect and scintillation probe measurements was found and there were no significant differences between the non-invasive and ex-vivo counting method after 8 weeks of follow up.\\tRESULTS\\nspect analysis of the total body and thyroid counts showed a limited accumulation of (125)i within the body.\\tRESULTS\\nectopic bone formation was induced in the scaffolds and the femur defects healed completely.\\tRESULTS\\nin vivo microct imaging detected the first signs of bone formation at days 14 and 28 for the orthotopic and ectopic implants, respectively, and provided a detailed profile of the bone formation rate.\\tRESULTS\\noverall, this study clearly demonstrates the benefit of applying non-invasive techniques in drug delivery-based bone regeneration strategies by providing detailed and reliable profiles of the growth factor retention and bone formation at different implantation sites in a limited number of animals.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis report is a comparative evaluation on the interaction of dorzolamide (dza) with bovine and human carbonic anhydrase ii (bca ii and hca ii, respectively) using fluorimetry, uv-vis and circular dichroism (cd) spectroscopy as well as molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nfluorescence data obtained at different temperatures indicated that dza quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of both enzymes through a static mechanism.\\tRESULTS\\nthermodynamic analysis of the quenching data revealed that hydrogen bonding and van der waals interactions play important roles in drug binding.\\tRESULTS\\ncalculations of the protein surface hydrophobicity (psh) index, using 1-anilinonaphtalene-8-sulfonate, also indicated a decrease in psh of the hca ii and minor increase in psh value of the bca ii upon drug binding.\\tRESULTS\\nthe results of far- and near-uv cd experiments showed some alterations in the secondary and tertiary structures of both enzymes upon ligation.\\tRESULTS\\nthe structural changes induced by drug binding caused more reduction in the catalytic activity of hca ii than bca ii.\\tRESULTS\\nbased on the experimental data and the possible binding mode revealed by molecular docking and molecular dynamic studies, we concluded that dza binds stronger to hca ii active site cavity compared to bca ii.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthis study investigated the generalization of deferred imitation in 6-, 9-, and 12-month-old infants across auditory and visual contexts.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe task involved testing for the imitation of demonstrated actions on an animal puppet 24h later.\\tMETHODS\\nthere were two independent variables defined by the background music and room of the infant\\'s home on the test day relative to the music and room present on the demonstration day.\\tMETHODS\\n6-month-olds generalized imitation only when the music and room on the test day were identical to their learning environment 24h earlier.\\tRESULTS\\n9-month-olds were able to generalize deferred imitation across a change in music but not a change in room.\\tRESULTS\\n12-month-olds were able to defer imitation across both a change in the room with the same music as well as a change in both the room and music.\\tRESULTS\\nthese results reveal that the similarity between the contextual conditions of encoding and retrieval across multiple contexts determine whether infants generalize and, furthermore, the necessity of such a similarity decreases with age.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe burden oral anticoagulation is a limitation of mechanical valve prostheses.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthe aim of this study was to test whether patients could be safely managed with dual-antiplatelet therapy (dapt) (aspirin 325 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg) or lower warfarin after on-x mechanical aortic valve replacement (mavr).\\tOBJECTIVE\\nproact (prospective randomized on-x

their experience particularly in relation to job satisfaction were analysed.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nincreased understanding of workplace organisation and culture can contribute to improved nurse work experience and better patient care.\\tBACKGROUND\\nworldwide many studies conducted on nurse experience and job satisfaction show that job satisfaction level varies across work settings so analysis of

(hgfd)-caused insulin resistance (ir) has not yet been studied.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis study evaluated the role of lavatera critica leaf extract (lce) in systemic insulin resistance through the alleviation of adipose tissue inflammation and oxidative damage in hgfd fed mice.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe mice were fed with hgfd for 10 weeks and the diet was supplemented with lce each day for the next five weeks.\\tMETHODS\\nbody weight, food intake, leptin, blood glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, and pro- and anti-in fl ammatory genes expression were assessed on day 106.\\tMETHODS\\nthe hgfd control mice displayed markedly elevated adipose tissue inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin inactivity, and hyperglycemia.\\tRESULTS\\nadministration of lce in the hgfd mice, especially a dose of 100mg/kg, lowered the body weight, food intake, plasma leptin, plasma glucose, plasma insulin, insulin resistance, and increased the food efficacy ratio when compared with the hgfd control mice.\\tRESULTS\\nthe oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt) revealed that lce prevented further increase in the circulating levels after the glucose load.\\tRESULTS\\nlce-treated mice demonstrated a marked suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines mrna expression.\\tRESULTS\\non the other hand, the mice showed a higher anti-in fl ammatory genes mrna expression in the adipose tissue.\\tRESULTS\\nin addition, lce treatment improved the oxidative damage as evidenced by the reduced levels of lipid hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances coupled with the increased antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, total glutathione, glutathione/glutathione disul fi de ratio and glutathione peroxidase) in the adipose tissue, plasma and erythrocytes.\\tRESULTS\\ngas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the bioactive compounds revealed the presence of 9, 12, 15-octadecatrienoic acid, vitamin e, phytol, hexadecanoic acid, benzenepropanoic acid, and stigmasterol.\\tRESULTS\\nthese findings prove that lce improves the insulin-sensitizing activity in the mouse model of hgfd-caused ir, probably due to the amelioration of adipose tissue inflammation and oxidative damage.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nhence, the lce could serve as a useful anti-diabetic agent.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nendothelial dysfunction is thought to be a major cause of vascular complications in

interpretations.\\tBACKGROUND\\nwe investigated whether priming by target selection in visual search and sensory memory for bistable perception are related.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nwe did this by presenting two trial types to observers.\\tMETHODS\\nwe presented either ambiguous spheres that rotated over a central axis and could be perceived as rotating in one of two directions, or search displays in which the unambiguously rotating target and distractor spheres closely resembled the two possible interpretations of the ambiguous stimulus.\\tMETHODS\\nwe interleaved both trial types within experiments, to see whether priming by target selection during search trials would affect the perceptual outcome of bistable perception and, conversely, whether sensory memory during bistable perception would affect target selection times during search.\\tMETHODS\\nwhereas we found intertrial repetition effects among consecutive search trials and among consecutive bistable trials, we did not find cross-paradigm effects.\\tRESULTS\\nthus, even though we could ascertain that our experiments robustly elicited processes of both search priming and sensory memory for bistable perception, these same

subjectively designed, the exact influence of the fin characteristics on swimming performance is still much debated, and remains difficult to quantify.\\tBACKGROUND\\nto date, the most common approach for evaluating swim fin propulsion is based on the study of \"swimmer-fins\" as a global system, where physiological and/or biomechanical responses are considered.\\tBACKGROUND\\nhowever, reproducible

correction of vesicoureteral reflux (vur) but also the long-term efficacy and safety of the tissue augmenting substance utilized for endoscopic correction.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis study retrospectively

safety of vantris((r)), and performed clinical and histological review of these patients.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe study population comprised 2495 patients who underwent endoscopic correction of vur utilizing deflux((r)) (1790) and vantris((r)) (705).\\tMETHODS\\ntissue sections were stained with hematoxylin & eosin and trichrome, and examined under a light microscope.\\tMETHODS\\nnine primary obstructive megaureters after ureteral re-implantation served as controls.\\tMETHODS\\nnine (0.5%) children (three female and six male) in the deflux group and nine (1.3%) (five females and four males) in the vantris group developed uvj obstruction and required ureteral re-implantation.\\tRESULTS\\nobstruction developed during the period ranging 2-49 months (average 16 months) following endoscopic correction.\\tRESULTS\\nthe primary reflux grade was iii in seven, iv in six, and v in six children.\\tRESULTS\\nthe mean volume of the injected material in all obstructed patients was 1.2 +/- 0.6 cc (mean +/- sd).\\tRESULTS\\nhistopathological analysis revealed a pseudocapsule composed of fibrous tissue and foreign-body giant cells surrounding the vantris implant in all patients.\\tRESULTS\\nthe distal part of the ureters demonstrated significant ureteral dilatation without ureteral fibrosis.\\tRESULTS\\nin all patients, additional biopsies from the muscularis propria adjacent to the injection site were examined and showed no significant abnormalities.\\tRESULTS\\nthere was an increased collagen deposition in the juxtavesical segment of the obstructive ureters following deflux and vantris injections, and of primary obstructive megaureter.\\tRESULTS\\nno significant difference was found in the tissue response between deflux and vantris patients and controls.\\tRESULTS\\nstatistical analysis of the nonhomogeneous population demonstrated higher obstruction rates in patients from the vantris group.\\tRESULTS\\nhowever, no statistical difference was demonstrated regarding the obstruction rate in the homogenous group with relation to gender, age and reflux grade group of patients.\\tRESULTS\\nmoreover, univariate analysis revealed that grade v reflux, the presence of beak sign on the reviewed pretreatment, and inflamed bladder mucosa upon injection were significant independent risk factors leading to obstruction.\\tRESULTS\\nthis study suggested that the underlining ureteral pathology lead to uvj obstruction following vantris injection.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthere was increased collagen deposition in the juxtavesical segment of the obstructive ureters following vantris injection.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nfurthermore, these findings were similar to those discovered in patients who underwent endoscopic correction with deflux, and in patients who required ureteral reimplantation due to primary obstructive megaureter.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nadditional biopsies from the muscularis propria adjacent to the injection site showed no significant abnormalities, ironing out the fact that vantris did not led to adverse tissue reaction following injection.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nunivariate analysis further ironed out the hypothesis that underlying ureteral pathology was responsible for the increased incidence of uvj obstruction and demonstrated that grade v reflux, the presence of beak sign on the reviewed pretreatment vcug, and inflamed bladder mucosa upon injection were significant independent risk factors leading to obstruction.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ndata showed that vantris injection did not lead to any different ureteral fibrosis or inflammatory changes to the tissue augmenting substances utilized in past and present clinical practice, and therefore did not seem to increase the incidence of uvj obstruction.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nhigh reflux grade, presence of obstructive/refluxing megaureter and inflamed bladder mucosa were the only statistically significant and independent predictive factors for uvj obstruction following endoscopic correction of vur.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nto identify the effect of duration of weight-bearing exercise and team sports participation on bone mineral density (bmd) and

lymphocytes emerging as critical players in the immune response to diverse infections and disease.\\tBACKGROUND\\ninkt cells are activated through cognate interactions with lipid-loaded apcs, by ag-independent cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, or a combination of both.\\tBACKGROUND\\nalthough each of these modes of inkt cell activation plays an important role in directing the humoral and cell-mediated immune response, the spatio-temporal nature of these interactions and the cellular requirements for activation are largely undefined.\\tBACKGROUND\\ncombining novel in situ confocal imaging of alphagalactosylceramide-loaded cd1d tetramer labeling to localize the endogenous inkt cell population with cytokine reporter mice, we reveal the choreography of early murine splenic inkt cell activation across diverse settings of glycolipid immunization and systemic infection with streptococcus pneumoniae.\\tMETHODS\\nwe find that inkt cells consolidate in the marginal zone and require dendritic cells lining the splenic marginal zone for activation following administration of cognate glycolipids and during systemic infection but not following exogenous cytokine administration.\\tRESULTS\\nalthough further establishing the importance of cognate inkt cell interactions with apcs, we also show that noncognate inkt-dependent mechanisms are sufficient to mediate effector outcomes, such as stat signaling and dendritic cell licensing throughout the splenic parenchyma.\\tRESULTS\\ncollectively, these data provide new insight into how inkt cells may serve as a natural adjuvant in facilitating adaptive immune responses, irrespective of their tissue localization.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\neisenmenger syndrome represents severe, irreversible, and end-stage pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) associated with congenital heart defects.\\tBACKGROUND\\nfor long-term outcome optimal right ventricular (rv) adaptation is crucial with precise assessment of its hypertrophy, dilatation and function.\\tBACKGROUND\\nassociations of electrocardiographic (ecg) and echocardiographic (echo) rv characteristics were analyzed.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nincluded were 52 patients (39f/13m), median age 45 years (24-78).\\tMETHODS\\nfollowing ecg parameters were analyzed: butler-leggett formula (b-l), sokolow-lyon criterion (s-l), qrs duration (qrs), maximum spatial qrs vector magnitude (qrs max); and echo parameters: rv diameter (rvd), rv wall thickness (rvaw), rv/lv function.\\tMETHODS\\nfollowing significant ecg-echo associations were demonstrated: s-l criterion and b-l formula with rvaw (p 120 ms only with severely dilated rv (rvd > 45 mm), while qrs max 33 mm); a new combined scoring system was introduced.\\tRESULTS\\nin eisenmenger syndrome rv hypertrophy is compensatory; diagnosis of prognostically unfavorable rv dilatation is therefore important.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\ncombined ecg-echo analysis enables more accurate risk stratification.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nqrs duration > 120 ms seems to be a late marker; qrs max together with echo parameters may help to distinguish patients at higher risk for clinical deterioration (tab. 3, fig. 8, ref. 53).\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nin the 2009 national health and medical research council (nhmrc) australian guidelines to reduce health risks from drinking, a guideline specific to lactating women was included.\\tBACKGROUND\\nfor the first time the effect of alcohol at this important developmental stage was nationally and internationally acknowledged.\\tBACKGROUND\\nto determine the degree to which maternal health practitioners adopted an australian national policy guideline (guideline 4b) on alcohol and breastfeeding into their everyday health practice and the factors associated with adoption.\\tOBJECTIVE\\na convenience sample of participants completed an online survey based on the nursing practice questionnaire (npq) to elicit measures of knowledge, awareness and practice implementation.\\tMETHODS\\nin total, 240 maternal health practitioners completed the online survey.\\tRESULTS\\nall statistical analyses clearly indicated a higher adoption of guideline 4b by the child health nurses, midwives and general practitioners (gps) than was the case for paediatricians and obstetricians.\\tRESULTS\\na mean adoption score (range 0-4) indicative of \\'some\\' practice implementation of 3.13, 3.04 and 2.73 was obtained by child health nurses, midwives and gps, respectively.\\tRESULTS\\nobstetricians and paediatricians scored a mean of 2.0, indicating they remain to be \\'persuaded about the practice\\' of incorporating discussions around alcohol and breastfeeding into their practice.\\tRESULTS\\ndespite the existence of a national alcohol guideline for breastfeeding women, maternal health practitioners are not incorporating this advice into their everyday practice with lactating women.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nopportunities exist for all maternal practitioners along the reproductive continuum to protect long-term breastfeeding duration using an evidence-based harm minimisation approach to alcohol consumption.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nnurses play a key role in the provision of services in relation to sexuality in both primary and sexual and reproductive health-care.\\tBACKGROUND\\ngiven the intersection of sexualities with a range of social injustices, this study reviews research on nursing practice concerning sexuality from an emancipatory/social justice perspective.\\tOBJECTIVE\\na systematic review of english articles published in nursing journals appearing on the web of science database from 2009 to 2014 was conducted.\\tMETHODS\\nthirty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria.\\tMETHODS\\nanalysis consisted of a descriptive phase (types and location of studies, aspects of sexualities focused on, target health users and aspects of nursing practice focused on) and a critical/emancipatory phase.\\tMETHODS\\nin terms of practice, our analysis revealed that: barriers exist to the integration of issues relating to sexuality in nursing practice; the social location of nurses and their personal feelings regarding sexuality influence their practice; content that addresses gendered norms and media that assist in communication underpin some emancipatory practices.\\tRESULTS\\nfew studies locate analyses of nursing practice within gendered, cultural and social norms; consider advocacy as part of the practice of nurses; or analyse the promotion of health user participation in health services and structures.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe implications for emancipatory practice are drawn out.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nempirical evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness estimates of particular health care technologies may be limited, or it may even be missing entirely.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin these situations, additional information, often in the form of expert judgments, is needed to reach a decision.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthere are formal methods to quantify experts\\' beliefs, termed as structured expert elicitation (see), but only limited research is available in support of methodological choices.\\tBACKGROUND\\nperhaps as a consequence, the use of see in the context of cost-effectiveness modelling is limited.\\tBACKGROUND\\nthis article reviews applications of see in cost-effectiveness modelling with the aim of summarizing the basis for methodological choices made in each application and recording the difficulties and challenges reported by the authors in the design, conduct, and analyses.\\tOBJECTIVE\\nthe methods used in each application were extracted along with the criteria used to support methodological and practical choices and any issues or challenges discussed in the text.\\tMETHODS\\nissues and challenges were extracted using an open field, and then categorised and grouped for reporting.\\tMETHODS\\nthe review demonstrates considerable heterogeneity in methods used, and authors acknowledge great methodological uncertainty in justifying their choices.\\tRESULTS\\nspecificities of the context area emerging as potentially important in determining further methodological research in elicitation are between- expert variation and its interpretation, the fact that substantive experts in the area may not be trained in quantitative subjects, that judgments are often needed on various parameter types, the need for some form of assessment of validity, and the need for more integration with behavioural research to devise relevant debiasing strategies.\\tRESULTS\\nthis review of experiences of see highlights a number of specificities/constraints that can shape the development of guidance and target future research efforts in this area.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nkaempferol is a member of the flavonoid compounds found in vegetables and fruits.\\tBACKGROUND\\nit is shown to exhibit biological impact and anticancer activity, but no report exists on the angiogenic effect of kaempferol and induction of cell apoptosis in vitro.\\tBACKGROUND\\nin this study, we investigated the role of kaempferol on anti-angiogenic property and the apoptotic mechanism of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs).\\tOBJECTIVE\\nour results demonstrated that kaempferol decreased huvec viability in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.\\tRESULTS\\nkaempferol also induced morphological changes and sub-g1 phase cell population (apoptotic cells).\\tRESULTS\\nkaempferol triggered apoptosis of huvecs as detecting by dna fragmentation, comet assay and immunofluorescent staining for activated caspase-3.\\tRESULTS\\nthe caspase signals, including caspase-8, -9 and -3, were time-dependently activated in huvecs after kaempferol exposure.\\tRESULTS\\nfurthermore, pre-treatment with a specific inhibitor of caspase-8 (z-ietd-fmk) significantly reduced the activity of caspase-8, -9 and -3, indicating that extrinsic pathway is a major signaling pathway in kaempferol-treated huvecs.\\tRESULTS\\nimportantly, kaempferol promoted reactive oxygen species (ros) evaluated using flow cytometric assay in huvecs.\\tRESULTS\\nwe further investigated the upstream extrinsic pathway and showed that kaempferol stimulated death receptor signals [fas/cd95, death receptor 4 (dr4) and dr5] through increasing the levels of phosphorylated p53 and phosphorylated atm pathways in huvecs, which can be individually confirmed by n-acetylcysteine (nac), atm specific inhibitor (caffeine) and p53 sirna.\\tRESULTS\\nbased on these results, kaempferol-induced huvec apoptosis was involved in an ros-mediated p53/atm/death receptor signaling.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nkaempferol might possess therapeutic effects on cancer treatment in anti-vascular targeting.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nacne vulgaris remains a challenging disease to treat in many patients.\\tBACKGROUND\\ntraditional therapies may have limited

populations.\\tOBJECTIVE\\npeer-reviewed research published between 2001 and 2016 was identified relevant to msp and headache in ad military personnel using mesh terms in key biomedical databases.\\tMETHODS\\ninclusion criteria were: epidemiological studies examining msp or headache as primary or secondary outcome; samples that included ad populations; and studies conducted in the theater of operations, at home station, and in military treatment or veterans health administration facilities.\\tMETHODS\\ntwenty-six articles met inclusion criteria.\\tRESULTS\\nlow back pain (lbp) was the most prevalent msp diagnosis.\\tRESULTS\\nthe incidence of lbp was 40.5 per 1,000 person-years and was comparable to nonmilitary populations.\\tRESULTS\\ninflammation and pain from overuse comprised the largest proportion of injury mechanism, accounting for about 82% of all injuries among nondeployed military personnel.\\tRESULTS\\nthe risk of msp was greater for ad, female, army, enlisted personnel, and those with greater time in a motor vehicle.\\tRESULTS\\nevidence suggests posttraumatic headache, occurring in up to 92% of military personnel who have sustained a mild traumatic brain injury, is associated with chronic daily headaches.\\tRESULTS\\nnurses must recognize the consequences military service can have on the development of pain.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nnurses have an opportunity to positively impact the health and well-being of military and veteran populations through early recognition and treatment of pain.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\nthe findings from this review underscore considerable magnitude of msp in military personnel and expose modifiable risk factors and potential targets for designing nurse-led interventions to improve pain and symptoms in military subpopulations.\\tCONCLUSIONS\\n'"
